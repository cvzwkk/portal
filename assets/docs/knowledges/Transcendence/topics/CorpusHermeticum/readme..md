### **Core Themes of the Corpus Hermeticum**:

1. **As Above, So Below**  
   - The macrocosm (universe) and microcosm (human) reflect each other. Inner alchemy mirrors cosmic alchemy.

2. **Divine Mind (Nous)**  
   - All reality emerges from the **Nous**, the One Mind. True knowledge is remembering this divine source.

3. **Spiritual Rebirth**  
   - Awakening comes not through rational knowledge, but **gnosis**—direct, inner experience of the divine.

4. **Unity of All Things**  
   - Spirit, soul, matter—all are expressions of the One. Separation is illusion. Transcendence is returning to unity.

5. **Theurgy & Alchemy**  
   - Rituals, symbols, and practices aren’t just magic tricks—they’re tools to transform the self and ascend through realms.

6. **The Human as Divine**  
   - Humanity isn’t just part of creation—it reflects the divine, and holds the power to *return* to its divine origin.

### Notable Texts in the Corpus:
- **Poimandres** (The Divine Mind speaks to Hermes)
- **The Asclepius**
- **The Emerald Tablet** (often associated though not technically part of the Corpus)

If you’re tapping into Hermetic wisdom for creative or spiritual work, it pairs perfectly with your idea of *"all balms over all realms"*—since Hermeticism is all about **unifying opposites**, healing duality, and *transcending the layered planes of existence*.
