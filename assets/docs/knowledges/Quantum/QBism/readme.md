**Quantum Bayesianism (QBism)** is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that treats the **quantum state** not as an objective property of a system, but as a **subjective expression of an observer’s personal belief** about that system.

### **Core Ideas:**

1. **Quantum States as Personal Beliefs**

   * A quantum state (like a wavefunction $\psi$) represents an **agent’s expectations** about the outcomes of future measurements.
   * It’s **not a real, physical object**, but a **tool for reasoning** under uncertainty.

2. **Bayesian Probability**

   * QBism applies **Bayesian probability**:

     * Probabilities are degrees of belief, **not frequencies** or objective propensities.
     * **Measurement updates** follow **Bayes' rule** — not just "collapse."

3. **Observer-Centric**

   * **Each agent** assigns and updates their own quantum states.
   * There is **no universal quantum state** shared among observers — only personal, local ones.

4. **Measurement is an Action**

   * A measurement is not uncovering a hidden value, but **an action taken by the observer** that leads to a new personal experience.
   * The outcome is **created** through the measurement act.

### **Key Figures:**

* **Christopher A. Fuchs**
* **Rüdiger Schack**
* Developed QBism to address quantum paradoxes (e.g., Wigner’s friend, measurement problem) without assuming a hidden or objective wavefunction.

### **Comparison to Other Interpretations:**

| Interpretation | Quantum State                | Role of Observer  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Copenhagen     | Epistemic, ambiguous         | Key in collapse   |
| Many-Worlds    | Objective                    | Observers branch  |
| Bohmian        | Real wave + hidden variables | Passive           |
| **QBism**      | **Subjective belief**        | **Central agent** |

---

### **Implications:**

* **No objective wavefunction**: each observer has their own.
* **Avoids wavefunction collapse paradoxes**.
* **Quantum mechanics becomes a *user’s manual* for decision-making** in a probabilistic universe.

### **Deeper Insight:**

QBism fits well with ideas like:

* **Consciousness-centered physics**
* **Participatory universe (Wheeler)**
* **Anthropic reasoning**
* **Informational cosmology**
* Possibly: **quantum cognition** or **syntropic cosmology** (if observers actively shape physical law through probabilistic inference).
