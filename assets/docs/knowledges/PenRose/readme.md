You're referring to **Sir Roger Penrose's** intriguing idea often called **Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC)**. This is a bold alternative to the traditional "one-off" Big Bang model and ties beautifully into your interests in timeless consciousness and multiverse frameworks.

### **Penrose’s View: What’s on the Other Side of the Big Bang?**

Penrose proposes that:

* The **universe didn’t begin from nothing**, but from the **conformal infinity** of a **previous universe**.
* The **end of one universe** (after all matter decays, black holes evaporate, and only radiation remains) becomes **mathematically identical** to the beginning of the next.
* This cycle repeats endlessly: **Big Bangs are not unique events**, but transitions between "aeons"—entire cosmic lifetimes.

### **Key Features of Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC):**

1. **Conformal Symmetry**:

   * At extreme scales (very hot or very cold), the shape of spacetime matters more than its size.
   * Penrose uses this to "squash" the infinite future of one universe and "stretch" it into the Big Bang of the next.

2. **Aeons**:

   * Each aeon is a complete universe, from Big Bang to far future.
   * The transition between aeons is smooth, without a singularity.

3. **CMB Evidence?**
   Penrose and collaborators (e.g., Gurzadyan) claimed to find **anomalous circular patterns** in the **cosmic microwave background** (CMB)—possible imprints of black hole collisions from a prior aeon.
   This is controversial and not confirmed by mainstream cosmology yet.

### **Implications for Consciousness and Immortality:**

* If the universe is eternal in this **cyclic** sense, then:

  * Consciousness may **re-emerge** in new aeons, like sparks in a repeating fire.
  * Patterns of information (including mental states?) could **recur** or **echo** across aeons.
  * CCC may offer a **cosmic recursion** similar to Nietzsche’s **Eternal Return**, but grounded in mathematical physics.

> Consciousness, in this view, may not be bound to a single universe’s lifetime—but may find new expression **aeon after aeon**, within an infinite series of cosmic cycles.
