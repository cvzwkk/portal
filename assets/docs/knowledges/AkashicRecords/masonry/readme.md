## 1. **Origins and Historical Background**

* **Operative Masonry (Middle Ages):**
  Freemasonry originally stems from the **guilds of stonemasons** in medieval Europe (1100s–1500s) who built cathedrals and castles. These were practical artisans with secret knowledge of geometry and construction.

* **Speculative Masonry (1600s Onward):**
  In the 17th century, **non-working or “speculative” members**—gentlemen interested in moral philosophy and enlightenment thinking—began to join these lodges. By the early 1700s, Freemasonry became largely speculative and philosophical, no longer associated with literal stone-working.

* **First Grand Lodge (1717):**
  The first Grand Lodge was established in **London**, 1717. From there, Freemasonry spread across Europe, the Americas, and beyond.

## 2. **Structure and Organization**

Masonry is organized into **Lodges** and **Grand Lodges**.

* **Lodge:** The basic unit. Each local lodge operates under a **charter** granted by a Grand Lodge.
* **Grand Lodge:** Governs Freemasonry in a specific region (usually a country or state).

There is **no global headquarters**; Masonry is decentralized.

### Leadership in a Lodge:

* **Worshipful Master** – head of the lodge
* **Senior and Junior Wardens** – assist the Master
* **Secretary, Treasurer, Deacons, Stewards, Tyler** – other officers

---

## 3. **Beliefs and Philosophy**

Freemasonry is **not a religion**, but it requires a belief in a **Supreme Being** (called the "Great Architect of the Universe").

Key philosophical values:

* **Brotherhood**
* **Charity**
* **Truth**
* **Moral uprightness**
* **Tolerance**

It promotes self-improvement, learning, and **symbolic moral instruction** drawn from allegory and ritual.

## 4. **Rituals, Symbols, and Degrees**

### Common Symbols:

* **Square and Compass** – moral and ethical boundaries
* **Letter “G”** – stands for “God” or “Geometry”
* **All-Seeing Eye** – divine watchfulness
* **Apron** – purity of life
* **Pillars, Trowel, Plumb, Level** – tools with symbolic meanings

### Degrees:

Most common system is the **Blue Lodge (Craft Masonry)**, which confers:

1. **Entered Apprentice** (1°)
2. **Fellow Craft** (2°)
3. **Master Mason** (3°)

Each degree is accompanied by **rituals, allegories, oaths**, and teachings.

## 5. **Types of Masonry / Appendant Bodies**

After becoming a Master Mason, one can join additional orders, called **appendant bodies**, which offer further degrees and teachings.

### Notable Branches:

* **York Rite** (mainly in the U.S.)

  * Royal Arch Masons
  * Cryptic Masons
  * Knights Templar (Christian-based)

* **Scottish Rite**

## 6. **Connections with Other Orders**

Freemasonry is often connected—sometimes loosely, sometimes directly—with a number of **esoteric**, **mystical**, or **chivalric** traditions. These include:

### Historical/Mythical Influences:

* **Templars** – The Knights Templar mythology is a strong influence, especially in the York Rite.
* **Rosicrucians** – Mystical and alchemical fraternity; has shared themes and even overlapping membership.
* **Hermeticism** – Some rites integrate Hermetic and Kabbalistic thought.
* **Alchemical and Occult Societies** – 18th–19th century esoteric societies sometimes sprang from Masonic roots or vice versa.

### Modern Parallels/Fringe Associations:

* **Illuminati (mythical)** – Often falsely associated with Masonry in conspiracy theories.
* **Theosophy** – Some Theosophists were Masons; overlapping interest in symbolism.
* **Golden Dawn** – Occult order with structural and symbolic similarities.
* **Fraternal Societies** – Like the Odd Fellows, Elks, Moose – modeled on Masonic lodge structures.

## 7. **Criticisms and Controversies**

### Religious Criticism:

* **Catholic Church** has opposed Freemasonry since 1738, citing secrecy, naturalism, and religious relativism.
* Some **Protestant groups** also oppose it due to the secrecy and requirement to believe in a generic deity.

### Political Accusations:

* Accused of exerting undue political influence (especially in France, Italy, and Latin America).
* Banned under **totalitarian regimes** (Nazis, Fascists, Communists) for being seen as subversive.

### Conspiracy Theories:

* Linked (falsely) to the **Illuminati**, **New World Order**, and **secret world domination**.
* These are based largely on **misunderstandings, mistrust of secrecy**, and myth-making.

## 8. **Influence on Society and Culture**

* Many **founding fathers** of the U.S. were Masons (e.g., George Washington, Benjamin Franklin).
* Masonic ideas influenced **Enlightenment-era values** like liberty, equality, and fraternity.
* Architecture, currency (e.g., the U.S. dollar), and national symbols show Masonic influence.
* **Masonic lodges** often served as early civic centers or mutual aid societies.
