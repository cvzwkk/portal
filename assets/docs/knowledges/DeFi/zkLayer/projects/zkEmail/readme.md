"zkEmail" refers to **Zero-Knowledge Email**, a concept or protocol that enables users to **prove something about an email's content or metadata without revealing the actual content** ‚Äî using **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**.

## üß© What is zkEmail?

At its core, **zkEmail** allows you to create a **ZK proof that you received a specific email**, or that the email satisfies certain conditions, without showing the full email. It‚Äôs used for **privacy-preserving authentication**, **proof of verification**, or **selective disclosure**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How Does It Work?

### 1. **Email Parsing**

* A system reads an email from a user (via IMAP or local EML format).
* It extracts metadata and message content.

### 2. **Preprocessing**

* The relevant parts (headers, body, fields like ‚Äúfrom‚Äù, ‚Äúto‚Äù, ‚Äúsubject‚Äù) are structured.
* Sometimes a Merkle tree is built from the content.

### 3. **ZK Circuit**

* A zk-SNARK/zk-STARK circuit is designed to:

  * Hash or process the message deterministically.
  * Prove a statement like:

    * "This email came from `@gov.br`."
    * "The subject contains ‚ÄòApproved‚Äô."
    * "The email contains a one-time password."

### 4. **Proof Generation**

* The circuit is executed to generate a proof.
* The verifier can check the proof without seeing the email content.

## üîê Use Cases

| Use Case                 | Description                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email-based Identity** | Prove you received a specific email from a domain (e.g. `@university.edu`) to verify student status.  |
| **KYC Verification**     | Show you passed KYC without revealing your personal data (e.g. from a provider‚Äôs confirmation email). |
| **Access Control**       | Grant access to a platform if a user received an invitation or approval email.                        |
| **Airdrop Eligibility**  | Receive crypto airdrops by proving you got a token distribution email.                                |

## üß™ Real Implementations

### ‚úÖ [zkEmail by Succinct Labs](https://github.com/succinctlabs/zk-email)

* Open-source repo that allows generation of ZK proofs from emails.
* Uses Circom + snarkjs for Groth16-based proof generation.
* Parses `.eml` format (standard email file).
* Built circuits to prove the presence of specific fields (e.g. `from`, `subject`, OTP values).

### ‚úÖ ZKProof-based Email Verification Systems

* Used in zkKYC, zkPassport, etc.
* Integrated with Ethereum and other blockchains for on-chain verification.

## üß† Example zkEmail Statement

> ‚ÄúI received an email from `noreply@openai.com` with subject `Account Verified` on August 5th.‚Äù

With zkEmail, you can **generate a ZK proof** of this **without showing the full email**, and **verify it on-chain** or off-chain.

## üöÄ zkEmail in Web3 Identity

zkEmail is often integrated into **decentralized identity protocols** like:

* **zkPass**: Use proof from your real-world email to attest something in a Web3 context.
* **Sismo**: zk-based reputation tools (e.g., prove you got a whitelist email).
* **Proof of Humanity / DAO membership**: Prove email invite to gated communities.

If you'd like, I can show you:

* How to generate a zkEmail proof using Circom.
* An example Solidity verifier for on-chain proof validation.
* Build a minimal zkEmail verification dApp.
