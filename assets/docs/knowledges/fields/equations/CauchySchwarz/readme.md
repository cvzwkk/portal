The **Cauchy–Schwarz inequality** (also called the Cauchy–Schwarz equation in some contexts) is a fundamental inequality in linear algebra and analysis. It provides a bound on the dot product (or inner product) of two vectors in terms of their magnitudes.

### In Inner Product Spaces:

For vectors $u$ and $v$ in an inner product space:

$$
|\langle u, v \rangle| \leq \|u\| \cdot \|v\|
$$

Equality holds **if and only if** $u$ and $v$ are linearly dependent.

### In Euclidean Space:

For real or complex sequences $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$:

$$
\left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n b_i^2 \right)
$$

Or in absolute value for complex numbers:

$$
\left| \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \overline{b_i} \right|^2 \leq \left( \sum_{i=1}^n |a_i|^2 \right) \left( \sum_{i=1}^n |b_i|^2 \right)
$$

Would you like a geometric interpretation or an example application of it?
