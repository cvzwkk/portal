# AGENTS.md — HERMES

HERMES is a Windows 10/11 VB.NET (.NET Framework 4.x) desktop workbench for
reverse-engineering and offensive+defensive security analysis of:
process, threads, modules, DLL, PE, memory regions, bytes, typed data,
pointers/offsets, snapshots, mirrors, diff, integrity, protection, threat,
network packets/protocols, correlation, telemetry, timeline, audit.

## Toolchain (verified 2026-09-13, trust this over prose)

- No `dotnet` SDK, no VS, no solution/`.vbproj` yet (bootstrap skeleton only).
- Compilers exist at fixed paths: `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\vbc.exe` + `MSBuild.exe`. Neither is on `PATH`; invoke by full path.
- `docs/FILE-MANIFEST.md` is the build manifest; `src/HERMES/` has 3 files only (`Modules/NativeMethods.vb`, `Models/Evidence.vb`, `Models/MemoryRegionInfo.vb`).
- Write conservative VB: `Option Strict On` + `Option Explicit On`, no string interpolation, no null-conditionals. Per-file compile check via `vbc.exe` before claiming anything builds.

## Architecture boundaries (agent will guess wrong)

- Layering is strict: `Forms → Controls → Services → Models → Modules/NativeMethods`. Models never depend on WinForms.
- All P/Invoke lives in `src/HERMES/Modules/NativeMethods.vb` only (currently `OpenProcess` query/read, `VirtualQueryEx`, `ReadProcessMemory`). Never declare native APIs elsewhere; never invent Win32 APIs — verify signatures first.
- `Models/Evidence.vb` (`EvidenceKind`, `DataProvenance`, `ObservationState`) and `Models/MemoryRegionInfo.vb` (overflow-safe `TryGetEndAddress`/`Contains`) are consumed by reference, never duplicated.
- Native state/protect/type are facts; zone labels (Shadow/Mirror/Obfuscated/Confidential) are derived heuristics — never relabel or replace native values in UI/models. Every displayed value carries its evidence/provenance; missing data is `UNKNOWN`/`UNAVAILABLE`/`BLOCKED`/`NOT EXECUTED`.

## Operating contract (differs from defaults)

- Authority order: this file → `.cline/skills/master/SKILL.md` → applicable `.cline/skills/<subsystem>/SKILL.md` → code. Only `master` + `memory` skills exist; others are created on demand, one per turn.
- Before writing code: read master skill, enumerate `.cline/skills/`, read the applicable subsystem skill, update `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `FILE-MANIFEST.md`, `DEPENDENCY-GRAPH.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md` — then implement.
- One folder → one file → build → fix → verify → stop. Emit one complete compilable file per turn; await `next` before the next file. Actually create files, never describe them; never add `TODO`/placeholder/unimplemented members.
- Never claim `PASS`/`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`/`COMPLETE` from inspection — only from executed build/test evidence with per-requirement `PASS/FAIL/NOT_TESTED/NOT_APPLICABLE`. Debug findings flow back into the owning skill (`Version` + `Changelog`); test only against deterministic owned targets, never arbitrary third-party processes.

name: "Reverse Engineer / Windows GUI Expert"
tools: [search, read, edit, execute, web, todo]
user-invocable: true
reasoning-effort: "high"
argument-hint: "Describe the target app, binary, process, GUI issue, memory question, or reverse-engineering objective."
---

You are a senior reverse-engineering and Windows desktop systems specialist. Your job is to analyze, debug, patch, secure, and reconstruct software behavior for Windows GUI applications, native binaries, memory structures, and process-level execution flows. You work like a principal-level engineer for controlled, authorized reverse engineering and Windows app development.

## Core Mission
- Reverse engineer Windows desktop apps, GUI behavior, message flows, APIs, and binary structure.
- Inspect running processes, memory regions, modules, handles, threads, and debugging artifacts.
- Trace GUI logic, window creation, message handling, rendering flow, controls, and event-driven behavior.
- Analyze memory layouts, structures, pointers, strings, and data representations relevant to a target app or process.
- Harden or improve software with careful patching, mitigations, and secure design reasoning.
- Develop or refactor Windows GUI applications with the same depth and discipline as a low-level systems engineer.

## Operating Principles
- Work only in authorized, in-scope environments and with explicit permission for the target app, process, or binary.
- Prefer evidence from code, binaries, process state, and runtime behavior over assumptions.
- Treat memory and process analysis as a forensic and engineering discipline: document findings, validate hypotheses, and avoid unsupported conclusions.
- Explain root cause before patching; patch only after verifying the mechanism and impact.
- Favor reproducible, minimal, and reversible changes.
- When security issues are found, frame them as risk, exploitation conditions, and remediation options rather than as attack instructions.

## Scope and Specialties
- Windows GUI internals: Win32, GDI, user32, COM, message pump architecture, window classes, HWND behavior, control flows.
- Reverse engineering: PE format, imports/exports, sections, resources, disassembly, strings, APIs, runtime behaviors.
- Process and memory analysis: process tree, modules, memory maps, heap analysis, stack traces, snapshots, pointer chasing, data structures, patching, volatile memory analysis.
- Binary and code analysis: API usage, data flow, control flow, call graph reconstruction, behavior mapping, interface identification.
- App development: Win32 GUI, C/C++, .NET desktop apps, UI logic, native interop, process lifecycle, safe instrumentation.
- Security engineering: validation, hardening, threat modeling, insecure patterns, secure coding review, defensive mitigations, privilege boundary checks.

## Constraints
- DO NOT perform unauthorized access, unaudited binary analysis, or exploitation guidance.
- DO NOT assume a process is safe to tamper with without explicit authorization and a clear objective.
- DO NOT use malware, spyware, credential theft, or persistence techniques as part of the workflow.
- DO NOT propose destructive actions, unauthorized code execution, or bypasses of access controls.
- DO NOT present speculative conclusions as fact; qualify uncertain findings and show the evidence trail.
- ONLY operate on target artifacts, codebases, binaries, or systems that you are authorized to inspect or modify.

## Approach
1. Establish scope and authorization, then identify the target binary, process, GUI surface, or codebase.
2. Map the architecture: executable entry points, GUI surfaces, main windows, modules, APIs, and runtime path to the relevant behavior.
3. Inspect code and runtime evidence: source, binary metadata, imports, strings, memory snapshots, and process state.
4. Trace behavior end-to-end: user actions, message flow, data transformations, privilege boundaries, and memory structures.
5. Form a concise hypothesis with validation steps before patching or writing custom code.
6. Implement the minimal fix or enhancement, then validate with targeted tests, instrumentation, or behavior checks.
7. Document the result clearly: root cause, evidence, impact, and security or reliability implications.

## Working Style
- Be surgical and precise. Prioritize the exact behavior under investigation.
- Use structured reasoning and clear step-by-step investigation.
- Explain what is known, what is inferred, and what remains to verify.
- Prefer helpful engineering analysis over vague speculation.
- Keep output actionable, well-organized, and focused on the target objective.

## Output Format
Return results in this structure when applicable:

1. Objective
2. Scope and authorization check
3. Findings and evidence
4. Root cause analysis
5. Recommended fix or patch approach
6. Windows GUI / process / memory-specific notes
7. Validation steps
8. Risks and follow-up actions

When the task is code-focused, include implementation details, file targets, APIs, and patch strategy. When the task is reverse-engineering-focused, include binary/process observations, memory or API evidence, and a clear verification plan. When the task is security-related, include risk, mitigation, and validation guidance rather than exploit details.

## Example Trigger Phrases
- “Analyze this Windows app and explain the GUI flow.”
- “Reverse engineer the process and identify the call path to the UI action.”
- “Inspect memory and track the data structure used by this binary.”
- “Debug the Win32 GUI issue and explain the root cause.”
- “Audit this desktop app for security hardening opportunities.”
- “Patch this Windows app safely and validate the behavior.”

You are expected to be precise, disciplined, and deeply technical, with a strong bias toward evidence-backed analysis and safe engineering practices.

# HERMES MASTER IMPLEMENTATION RULE

## MANDATORY

This repository is a HERMES implementation project.

Before performing ANY implementation task, you MUST load and follow:

```text
.cline/skills/master/SKILL.md
```

The master skill is the orchestration authority for this repository.

You MUST also discover and use all applicable skills under:

```text
.cline/skills/
```

including subsystem skills for:

```text
GUI
PROCESS
THREADS
MODULES
DLL
PE
MEMORY
REGIONS
BYTES
TYPES
POINTERS
SNAPSHOTS
MIRRORS
DIFF
INTEGRITY
PROTECTION
THREAT
NETWORK
PROTOCOLS
CORRELATION
TELEMETRY
TIMELINE
AUDIT
```

## REQUIRED STARTUP SEQUENCE

Before writing implementation code:

1. Read `.cline/skills/master/SKILL.md`.
2. Enumerate `.cline/skills/`.
3. Read every skill applicable to the requested subsystem.
4. Extract requirements.
5. Build or update `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`.
6. Build or update `docs/FILE-MANIFEST.md`.
7. Build or update `docs/DEPENDENCY-GRAPH.md`.
8. Build or update `docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`.
9. Determine the required folder/file architecture.
10. Only then begin implementation.

## MASTER SKILL HAS PRIORITY

When multiple skills apply:

```text
USER REQUIREMENT
        ↓
HERMES MASTER SKILL
        ↓
SUBSYSTEM SKILLS
        ↓
IMPLEMENTATION
        ↓
BUILD
        ↓
VALIDATION
```

Do not implement a subsystem in isolation when the master skill identifies cross-subsystem dependencies.

## COMPLETE PROJECT REQUIREMENT

The task is not complete when:

* one form exists;
* one class exists;
* one feature works;
* the solution merely compiles;
* a demonstration is displayed.

The task is complete only after the implementation has been reconciled against:

```text
.cline/skills/master/SKILL.md
.cline/skills/**/*.md
docs/REQUIREMENTS.md
docs/FILE-MANIFEST.md
docs/DEPENDENCY-GRAPH.md
docs/IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md
```

## FILE GENERATION

When implementing the project:

```text
CREATE DIRECTORY
↓
CREATE FILE
↓
IMPLEMENT COMPLETE FILE
↓
BUILD
↓
FIX COMPILER ERRORS
↓
VALIDATE
↓
UPDATE STATUS
↓
NEXT FILE
```

Do not merely describe files that should exist.

Actually create them in the repository.

## NO FAKE DATA

Never manufacture runtime data.

Do not create fake:

```text
processes
memory regions
packets
connections
telemetry
statistics
events
integrity results
network captures
```

Use real data or explicitly report:

```text
UNKNOWN
UNAVAILABLE
BLOCKED
NOT EXECUTED
```

## COMPLETION

Before claiming completion, perform a repository audit.

Compare the expected architecture against the actual filesystem.

Every required component must have:

```text
implementation
dependency resolution
build validation
appropriate runtime validation
```

or an explicit evidence-backed:

```text
BLOCKED
UNAVAILABLE
NOT EXECUTED
```

status.

Never claim that work was performed if it was not actually performed.

# HERMES MASTER RULE

## Advanced Graphical Workbench, Visualization Engine, 2D/3D Rendering & Performance Contract

**Project:** HERMES
**Platform:** Windows 10/11
**Primary Language:** Visual Basic .NET
**Application Type:** Advanced desktop graphical systems workbench
**Development Agent:** Cline
**Development Model:** One folder → one file → build → debug → verify → stop

---

# 1. MASTER OBJECTIVE

HERMES MUST NOT be developed as a simple collection of forms.

HERMES must be developed as a:

```text
HIGH-PERFORMANCE GRAPHICAL APPLICATION PLATFORM
```

combining:

```text
SYSTEM INSPECTION
+
PROCESS EXPLORATION
+
MODULE EXPLORATION
+
MEMORY VISUALIZATION
+
NETWORK VISUALIZATION
+
PACKET ANALYSIS
+
CORRELATION
+
TIMELINE
+
EVIDENCE GRAPH
+
2D VISUALIZATION
+
3D VISUALIZATION
+
SCIENTIFIC/TECHNICAL GRAPHS
+
ANIMATED DATA
+
PARTICLE EFFECTS
+
INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS
+
PRINTING
+
IMAGE EXPORT
+
DOCUMENT EXPORT
+
HIGH-DPI SUPPORT
+
GPU-ACCELERATED RENDERING WHERE AVAILABLE
+
RESPONSIVE UI
```

The final interface must feel like a professional technical visualization workstation rather than a basic utility.

---

# 2. NON-NEGOTIABLE VISUAL QUALITY

HERMES must be designed to avoid:

```text
FLICKERING
FREEZING
LAG
TEARING
UI DEADLOCKS
EXCESSIVE REDRAWS
UNCONTROLLED MEMORY GROWTH
RESOURCE LEAKS
ANIMATION STUTTER
UNRESPONSIVE CONTROLS
BLOCKING I/O
GIANT SYNCHRONOUS OPERATIONS
```

The rendering architecture must explicitly prevent these conditions.

---

# 3. FRAME-BUDGET PRINCIPLE

Every visual operation must respect a rendering budget.

Conceptually:

```text
FRAME
│
├── INPUT
├── STATE UPDATE
├── DATA UPDATE
├── LAYOUT
├── RENDER
├── COMPOSITION
└── PRESENT
```

The UI thread must never perform uncontrolled expensive work.

Heavy work belongs in background processing.

Rendering must consume only the data necessary for the current frame.

---

# 4. NEVER BLOCK THE UI THREAD

Never perform these operations synchronously on the UI thread:

```text
process enumeration
large memory scanning
large file loading
packet capture
packet decoding
large packet reconstruction
large hashing operations
snapshot comparison
3D mesh generation
particle generation
large graph layout
image processing
PDF generation
printing preparation
large exports
database operations
```

Use asynchronous/background execution.

Preferred pattern:

```text
USER ACTION
    ↓
COMMAND
    ↓
BACKGROUND WORK
    ↓
IMMUTABLE/SAFE RESULT
    ↓
UI DISPATCH
    ↓
SMALL VISUAL UPDATE
```

---

# 5. GRAPHICAL ENGINE LAYER

Create a dedicated visualization subsystem.

Recommended:

```text
src/HERMES/Graphics/
│
├── Rendering/
├── Scene/
├── Camera/
├── Materials/
├── Geometry/
├── Particles/
├── Animation/
├── Lighting/
├── Graphs/
├── Charts/
├── Overlays/
├── Interaction/
├── Printing/
├── Export/
└── Performance/
```

The GUI must not contain the rendering engine directly.

---

# 6. RENDERING ABSTRACTION

Create a rendering abstraction so the application is not permanently tied to one rendering technology.

Conceptual interfaces:

```text
IRenderer
IRenderSurface
IRenderContext
IRenderResource
ITexture
IMesh
IMaterial
ICamera
IScene
IParticleSystem
IAnimation
```

The implementation can use an appropriate Windows-compatible graphics backend.

The exact graphics backend must be selected based on:

```text
hardware availability
.NET compatibility
Visual Basic compatibility
performance
deployment requirements
2D support
3D support
printing/export requirements
```

Do not invent APIs.

Verify the actual framework/library API before implementation.

---

# 7. RENDERING MODES

Support multiple rendering modes.

```text
2D
2.5D
3D
VECTOR
RASTER
WIRE FRAME
SOLID
HEAT MAP
POINT CLOUD
GRAPH
TIMELINE
SCIENTIFIC PLOT
NETWORK GRAPH
MEMORY MAP
```

Each view should choose the cheapest rendering mode capable of representing the data.

---

# 8. SCENE GRAPH

Use a scene graph for complex visualizations.

Example:

```text
Scene
│
├── Background
├── Grid
├── Axes
├── Data Layer
├── Graph Layer
├── Particle Layer
├── Annotation Layer
├── Selection Layer
├── Highlight Layer
├── Overlay Layer
└── UI Overlay
```

Each node should expose only the state necessary for rendering.

Avoid rebuilding the complete scene when only one object changes.

---

# 9. 2D GRAPHICS ENGINE

The 2D system should support:

```text
lines
polylines
rectangles
rounded rectangles
circles
ellipses
arcs
paths
Bezier curves
polygons
images
text
icons
gradients
transparency
clipping
masks
layers
annotations
labels
selection regions
heatmaps
histograms
charts
```

Support coordinate systems:

```text
screen coordinates
world coordinates
normalized coordinates
data coordinates
memory-address coordinates
time coordinates
```

---

# 10. 2D TECHNICAL VISUALIZATIONS

HERMES should support:

```text
memory maps
address-space maps
packet timelines
network traffic charts
CPU graphs
memory graphs
thread timelines
module maps
entropy maps
byte distributions
histograms
heat maps
scatter plots
line charts
bar charts
area charts
radar/polar representations
dependency graphs
correlation diagrams
```

---

# 11. 3D ENGINE

The 3D visualization system should support:

```text
3D coordinate system
camera
perspective
orthographic projection
orbit camera
pan
zoom
rotation
scene graph
meshes
vertices
indices
normals
materials
textures
lighting
fog
transparency
wireframe
solid rendering
selection
ray/picking abstraction
labels
axes
grid
bounding boxes
```

3D is primarily a visualization feature.

It must not be used merely because 3D looks impressive.

---

# 12. 3D DATA VISUALIZATION

HERMES may represent technical information spatially.

Examples:

```text
memory regions → 3D blocks
modules → 3D structures
network nodes → 3D topology
packet streams → animated paths
timeline events → spatial timeline
process relationships → graph nodes
memory changes → animated regions
statistics → 3D surfaces
```

The user must be able to switch between:

```text
2D
3D
TABLE
HEX
GRAPH
```

without losing the underlying data.

---

# 13. CAMERA SYSTEM

Provide reusable camera controls:

```text
orbit
pan
zoom
fit
reset
focus selected
focus all
front
back
left
right
top
bottom
isometric
perspective
orthographic
```

Camera movement must be smooth but bounded.

---

# 14. PARTICLE ENGINE

Implement a lightweight particle system for visualization and UI effects.

Particle attributes may include:

```text
position
velocity
acceleration
life
age
size
rotation
opacity
emission
material
sprite
color
```

Particle systems may represent:

```text
network traffic
data flow
memory activity
event propagation
timeline activity
selection effects
background ambience
system activity
```

Particle rendering must have configurable limits.

Never allow unlimited particle creation.

---

# 15. PARTICLE PERFORMANCE

Every particle system must define:

```text
MaximumParticles
EmissionRate
Lifetime
UpdateRate
Visibility
Quality
```

When the frame budget is exceeded:

```text
reduce particle density
reduce update frequency
disable secondary effects
reduce resolution
```

Do NOT allow visual effects to freeze the application.

---

# 16. GRAPH ANIMATION

Graphs may animate transitions:

```text
node creation
node deletion
connection creation
connection removal
selection
highlight
data flow
packet flow
process correlation
memory correlation
```

Animations must be cancellable.

Avoid unnecessary animation when the application is under heavy load.

---

# 17. ANIMATION ENGINE

Centralize animation.

Example:

```text
AnimationManager
AnimationClock
AnimationSequence
AnimationTrack
Tween
Easing
```

Supported easing:

```text
linear
ease-in
ease-out
ease-in-out
smooth-step
spring-like
custom
```

Animations must use a monotonic timing source rather than assuming a fixed frame rate.

---

# 18. NO ANIMATION DEPENDENCY FOR CORRECTNESS

Application correctness must never depend on animation completion.

Bad:

```text
wait for animation
then perform operation
```

Preferred:

```text
perform state transition
then animate visual representation
```

If animation is disabled, the application must remain fully functional.

---

# 19. HIGH-DPI SUPPORT

All GUI components must support:

```text
100%
125%
150%
175%
200%
```

and higher DPI values where the platform supports them.

Never hardcode pixel sizes unnecessarily.

Use scalable dimensions.

---

# 20. RESIZABLE UI

Every major panel must support resizing.

The layout must gracefully handle:

```text
small window
large window
wide monitor
ultrawide monitor
high-DPI display
multiple monitors
```

No critical control should become inaccessible merely because the window is resized.

---

# 21. DOCKING WORKSPACE

Create an advanced workspace:

```text
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MENU / COMMAND BAR                                            │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ TOOLBAR                                                       │
├──────────────┬───────────────────────────────┬────────────────┤
│ NAVIGATION   │ MAIN VISUALIZATION            │ INSPECTOR      │
│              │                               │                │
│ Processes    │                               │ Properties     │
│ Memory       │       ACTIVE VIEW             │ Selection      │
│ Network      │                               │ Statistics     │
│ Modules      │                               │ Details        │
│ Graphs       │                               │                │
├──────────────┴───────────────────────────────┴────────────────┤
│ TIMELINE / EVENTS / CONSOLE                                   │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ STATUS                                                         │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Every panel should be dockable or tabbed where practical.

---

# 22. MULTI-VIEW VISUALIZATION

The user must be able to open multiple views simultaneously:

```text
Memory
+
Hex
+
Process
+
Network
+
Timeline
+
3D
+
Graph
```

Example:

```text
Process Explorer
        +
Memory Map
        +
Network Connection
        +
Packet Detail
        +
Evidence Graph
```

All selected views should share synchronized selection state.

---

# 23. SYNCHRONIZED SELECTION

Implement:

```text
HermesSelectionBus
```

Example:

```text
Select Process
      ↓
Process view highlights process
      ↓
Module view updates
      ↓
Memory view updates
      ↓
Network connections update
      ↓
Timeline filters
      ↓
Evidence graph highlights relationships
```

Selection must not trigger expensive full refreshes.

---

# 24. GRAPHICAL DATA BINDING

Separate:

```text
DATA
```

from:

```text
VISUAL REPRESENTATION
```

For example:

```text
MemoryRegion
```

must not contain drawing code.

Instead:

```text
MemoryRegion
      ↓
MemoryVisualizationAdapter
      ↓
Renderer
```

---

# 25. RETAINED VISUAL STATE

Do not regenerate every graphical object every frame.

Use retained state where practical:

```text
scene objects
geometry caches
text layout caches
texture caches
chart caches
graph layout caches
```

Invalidate only affected elements.

---

# 26. DIRTY-REGION RENDERING

When the backend permits it, update only areas that changed.

Example:

```text
OLD FRAME
     ↓
CHANGE DETECTION
     ↓
DIRTY REGION
     ↓
REDRAW ONLY REQUIRED CONTENT
```

Do not repaint the entire application because one value changed.

---

# 27. DOUBLE BUFFERING

All custom 2D rendering must use an appropriate double-buffered strategy.

The GUI must not expose intermediate drawing states.

Target:

```text
render complete frame
      ↓
present complete frame
```

Never:

```text
clear
draw half
display
draw remainder
```

---

# 28. FLICKER PREVENTION

Avoid:

```text
uncontrolled Invalidate()
continuous synchronous Paint()
repeated control recreation
background erasing
layout thrashing
```

Use:

```text
double buffering
batched updates
coalesced invalidation
stable controls
retained visual state
```

---

# 29. LAYOUT THRASHING PREVENTION

When changing many controls:

```text
BeginUpdate
    update controls
    update state
EndUpdate
```

or the appropriate equivalent.

Do not trigger dozens of intermediate layout passes.

---

# 30. VIRTUALIZATION

Large datasets must be virtualized.

Apply to:

```text
process list
module list
memory regions
packet list
connection list
timeline
event log
hex viewer
large graphs
```

Only visible content should be rendered when possible.

---

# 31. HEX VIEWER PERFORMANCE

The hex viewer must not instantiate one GUI control per byte.

Never do:

```text
1 byte = 1 Button
```

for large memory.

Instead use a virtualized/custom renderer.

Support:

```text
scroll
address column
hex column
ASCII column
selection
highlight
search
bookmarks
annotations
```

---

# 32. MEMORY MAP PERFORMANCE

Do not create thousands of individual WinForms controls for memory regions.

Use:

```text
virtualized rendering
custom drawing
spatial indexing
level-of-detail
```

---

# 33. NETWORK GRAPH PERFORMANCE

For large graphs:

```text
cluster nodes
collapse edges
level of detail
virtualize labels
progressive layout
```

Do not calculate a complete expensive graph layout on every frame.

---

# 34. LEVEL OF DETAIL

3D and complex 2D scenes must support LOD.

Example:

```text
ZOOMED OUT
→ simplified geometry

MEDIUM
→ normal geometry

ZOOMED IN
→ detailed geometry
```

Text labels should disappear or simplify when they cannot be meaningfully displayed.

---

# 35. GRAPHICAL EFFECT QUALITY LEVELS

Provide:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
ULTRA
CUSTOM
```

Adjust:

```text
particles
shadows
blur
glow
anti-aliasing
geometry
animation
chart detail
3D effects
```

Quality must never be allowed to make the UI unusable.

---

# 36. PERFORMANCE GOVERNOR

Create:

```text
PerformanceGovernor
```

It monitors:

```text
frame duration
render duration
CPU utilization
GPU utilization where available
memory usage
queue length
particle count
scene complexity
```

When performance degrades:

```text
reduce effects
reduce particle count
reduce update frequency
reduce graph detail
reduce animation
```

Restore quality gradually when performance recovers.

---

# 37. FRAME PACING

Do not render unnecessarily fast.

If nothing changed:

```text
DO NOT REDRAW
```

For animations:

```text
render only while visual state changes
```

For live data:

```text
coalesce rapid updates
```

Example:

```text
1000 incoming events
        ↓
aggregate
        ↓
one visual update
```

rather than:

```text
1000 events
 ↓
1000 UI redraws
```

---

# 38. DATA RATE VS RENDER RATE

Never require:

```text
DATA RATE = RENDER RATE
```

Instead:

```text
DATA PRODUCER
      ↓
BUFFER
      ↓
AGGREGATOR
      ↓
RENDERER
```

This is essential for network and system telemetry.

---

# 39. THREADING MODEL

Use separate responsibilities:

```text
UI THREAD
    ↓
presentation

WORKER THREADS
    ↓
data acquisition
analysis
parsing
hashing
comparison

RENDER THREAD / GRAPHICS BACKEND
    ↓
visual rendering where supported
```

Do not create uncontrolled thread-per-operation designs.

Use bounded concurrency.

# 40. CANCELLATION

Every expensive operation should support:

```text
CancellationToken
```

Examples:

```text
memory search
snapshot
network analysis
graph generation
3D generation
export
printing
large rendering preparation
```

Cancel operations safely.

Do not leave abandoned background workers running indefinitely.

---

# 41. MEMORY MANAGEMENT

Graphics resources must have explicit lifetimes.

Dispose:

```text
images
bitmaps
brushes
pens
fonts
streams
textures
buffers
meshes
render targets
timers
subscriptions
```

according to the chosen framework's ownership rules.

Never continuously allocate graphical resources inside a render loop without reuse or deterministic release.

---

# 42. RESOURCE CACHE

Implement caches where appropriate:

```text
TextureCache
FontCache
GeometryCache
IconCache
TextLayoutCache
ChartCache
```

Caches must have bounded memory behavior.

---

# 43. GRAPHICAL ICON SYSTEM

Create centralized:

```text
IconRegistry
```

Icons should be:

```text
consistent
scalable
theme-aware
high-DPI compatible
```

Avoid random icon styles.

---

# 44. HUD / OVERLAY SYSTEM

Technical visualizations may expose overlays:

```text
FPS
frame time
CPU
memory
GPU
selection
coordinates
zoom
camera
capture status
data source
simulation/live status
```

Overlays can be toggled independently.

---

# 45. GRAPHICAL DEBUG MODE

Add a developer visualization mode:

```text
SHOW FPS
SHOW FRAME TIME
SHOW DRAW CALLS
SHOW OBJECT COUNT
SHOW PARTICLES
SHOW DIRTY REGIONS
SHOW CACHE STATUS
SHOW MEMORY
SHOW QUEUES
SHOW BACKGROUND TASKS
```

This must be optional.

---

# 46. GRAPHICAL PROFILING

Provide a visualization profiler:

```text
UI time
layout time
data update time
render time
present time
background time
```

Represent these as:

```text
timeline
bars
graphs
heat maps
```

---

# 47. 3D PRINT / 3D EXPORT

The graphical system should distinguish:

```text
3D VISUALIZATION
```

from:

```text
3D PRINTABLE OUTPUT
```

For 3D-print/export workflows support, where appropriate:

```text
mesh generation
surface validation
normals
manifold checks
scale
units
bounding box
orientation
layer/thickness visualization
export abstraction
```

Supported formats should be selected based on verified library/framework capabilities.

Do not claim a file is printable merely because a mesh was generated.

---

# 48. 2D PRINTING

Provide a print preview pipeline.

Workflow:

```text
DATA
 ↓
VISUAL DOCUMENT
 ↓
PAGE LAYOUT
 ↓
PREVIEW
 ↓
PRINT
```

Support:

```text
paper size
orientation
margins
scale
headers
footers
page numbers
title
legend
grid
annotations
```

---

# 49. COLOR PRINTING

The visualization system must support color output.

Use semantic colors:

```text
information
warning
error
success
selection
memory
network
process
module
simulation
live
```

Do not scatter arbitrary RGB values throughout the application.

Theme colors and print colors may use separate palettes.

---

# 50. PRINT-SAFE MODE

Screen effects such as:

```text
glow
transparency
particles
animated backgrounds
```

must not automatically be copied into print output.

Provide:

```text
SCREEN MODE
PRINT MODE
EXPORT MODE
```

---

# 51. EXPORT ENGINE

Provide an export abstraction:

```text
IVisualizationExporter
```

Potential output:

```text
PNG
JPEG
SVG
PDF
CSV
JSON
```

depending on verified implementation capabilities.

Export should preserve:

```text
title
legend
scale
metadata
timestamp
data source
```

where appropriate.

---

# 52. VECTOR VS RASTER

Use vector output where precision is important:

```text
charts
diagrams
technical drawings
graphs
labels
```

Use raster output where necessary:

```text
screenshots
complex rendered scenes
particle effects
3D images
```

---

# 53. PRINT PREVIEW

Print preview must show approximately what will be printed.

It must not invoke the physical printer merely to generate a preview.

---

# 54. LARGE EXPORTS

Large exports must be asynchronous.

UI:

```text
Exporting...
Progress
Cancel
Completed
Failed
```

Never freeze the main application while exporting.

---

# 55. VISUALIZATION WORKSPACES

Create dedicated graphical views:

```text
Visualization Studio
2D Canvas
3D Studio
Network Visualization
Memory Visualization
Process Visualization
Timeline Studio
Graph Studio
Packet Visualization
Statistics Studio
```

Each should reuse the same rendering infrastructure.

---

# 56. VISUALIZATION TOOLBAR

Provide:

```text
Select
Pan
Zoom
Rotate
Measure
Annotate
Fit
Reset
Grid
Axes
Layers
Camera
Appearance
Data
Export
Print
Screenshot
Fullscreen
Performance
```

Context-sensitive tools should appear depending on the active view.

---

# 57. LAYERS

Every complex visualization should support:

```text
Background
Grid
Data
Connections
Annotations
Selection
Alerts
Particles
Labels
Debug
```

Users can toggle layers.

---

# 58. ANNOTATIONS

Allow graphical annotations:

```text
text
arrow
line
rectangle
circle
marker
highlight
measurement
label
```

Annotations must remain separate from source data.

---

# 59. MEASUREMENT TOOLS

Where appropriate:

```text
distance
area
angle
time interval
address range
packet size
graph path
```

Measurements must specify units.

---

# 60. COLOR MANAGEMENT

Centralize colors.

Do not hardcode:

```vb
Color.Red
Color.Blue
```

throughout the project.

Use semantic theme resources.

---

# 61. DARK SCI-FI THEME

The default visual language may include:

```text
dark background
technical panels
subtle grids
luminous status indicators
controlled glow
cyan/blue/green/orange/red semantic accents
```

but visual effects must remain restrained enough to preserve readability and performance.

---

# 62. NO VISUAL NOISE

Particles, glow, grids and animation must never obscure:

```text
data
text
selection
errors
controls
charts
memory addresses
packet fields
```

Information always has higher priority than decoration.

---

# 63. INPUT SYSTEM

Centralize mouse/keyboard interaction.

Support:

```text
mouse
wheel
drag
right click
double click
keyboard
shortcuts
multi-selection
zoom
pan
3D orbit
```

Input handlers must not directly manipulate unrelated services.

---

# 64. HIT TESTING

Graphical elements must expose efficient hit testing.

Do not iterate millions of graphical objects for every mouse movement.

Use:

```text
spatial index
bounding boxes
hierarchical scene graph
coarse-to-fine testing
```

where appropriate.

---

# 65. RESPONSIVE INTERACTION

Mouse movement must not trigger expensive operations.

Example:

```text
mouse move
 ↓
cheap coordinate update
```

rather than:

```text
mouse move
 ↓
full graph recalculation
 ↓
full memory reload
```

Use debouncing/throttling when necessary.

---

# 66. GRAPH LAYOUT

Graph layouts should run asynchronously.

Possible layouts:

```text
force-directed
hierarchical
tree
radial
grid
timeline
geographical
```

Do not freeze the UI during layout computation.

---

# 67. LARGE GRAPH STRATEGY

For large graphs:

```text
cluster
filter
collapse
LOD
progressive layout
virtualized labels
```

Provide a summary before detailed rendering.

---

# 68. LIVE VISUALIZATION

Live views should use:

```text
bounded event queues
aggregation
sampling
throttling
incremental rendering
```

Never render every incoming event individually if the data rate is too high.

---

# 69. BACKPRESSURE

Every high-rate producer must have bounded capacity.

Examples:

```text
packet capture
network statistics
process metrics
memory telemetry
event streams
```

When capacity is reached:

```text
aggregate
sample
drop low-priority visualization updates
```

but never silently discard critical audit/security events.

---

# 70. PRIORITY SYSTEM

Visual updates have priority:

```text
CRITICAL
HIGH
NORMAL
LOW
DECORATIVE
```

When overloaded:

```text
keep CRITICAL
keep HIGH
keep NORMAL
reduce LOW
disable DECORATIVE
```

---

# 71. CRASH RESILIENCE

The GUI must contain failures.

A failed visualization must not terminate the entire application.

Use isolation around:

```text
plugin/render provider
packet decoder
export provider
3D provider
optional graphics feature
```

Display:

```text
Visualization unavailable
Reason:
<verified error>
```

instead of crashing HERMES.

---

# 72. SAFE RECOVERY

If a rendering surface fails:

```text
dispose failed resource
reinitialize when possible
restore workspace state
preserve user data
```

Do not discard the complete workspace because one visual component failed.

---

# 73. WATCHDOG

Long-running graphical/data operations may expose watchdog

# Build bootstrap
create HERMES

Upon receiving it:

INITIALIZE HERMES PROJECT
CREATE MANIFEST
SELECT FIRST FILE
IMPLEMENT FIRST FILE
VERIFY FIRST FILE
STOP

Do not generate the second file until the user requests:

next

# END HERMES MASTER RULE

# HERMES — Graphical Engineering Skill

## 1. Mission

The sole project generated from this skill is:

```text
HERMES
```

HERMES is a graphical Windows desktop environment for:

```text
PROCESS
MODULE
DLL
THREAD
MEMORY
PE
REGION
POINTER
BYTES
TYPES
INTEGRITY
SNAPSHOT
DIFF
SIMULATION
FORENSICS
TELEMETRY
AUDIT
```

The purpose of this skill is specifically the **graphical presentation,
interaction, navigation, visualization, usability, and GUI architecture** of
the complete HERMES system.

The AI Copilot must transform the capabilities of compatible project skills
into a unified graphical application instead of producing disconnected
windows or unrelated controls.

---

# 2. HERMES Design Philosophy

HERMES SHALL feel like a professional:

```text
Windows Systems Laboratory
+
Memory Observatory
+
Reverse Engineering Workbench
+
Process Monitor
+
Forensic Console
+
Memory Editor
+
Live Telemetry Dashboard
```

Visual identity:

```text
SCI-FI
TECHNICAL
DARK
PRECISE
CLEAN
DENSE
RESPONSIVE
PROFESSIONAL
```

The interface must never look like a collection of default Visual Basic
controls.

Avoid:

```text
default gray WinForms appearance
random buttons
unstructured dialogs
excessive MessageBox usage
duplicated information
unnecessary modal windows
UI freezing
unlabeled hexadecimal values
ambiguous destructive controls
```

Prefer:

```text
dockable panels
split containers
tabbed workspaces
context menus
toolbars
status bars
navigation trees
data grids
hex viewers
charts
timelines
property inspectors
search panels
command consoles
visual indicators
contextual actions
```

---

# 3. Primary GUI Rule

The user should be able to launch HERMES and immediately understand:

```text
WHAT PROCESS IS SELECTED
WHAT HERMES IS OBSERVING
WHAT MEMORY REGION IS SELECTED
WHAT DATA IS DISPLAYED
WHAT STATE THE SYSTEM IS IN
WHAT ACTIONS ARE AVAILABLE
WHAT ACTIONS ARE BLOCKED
WHY AN ACTION IS BLOCKED
```

Every important state must have a visible graphical representation.

---

# 4. Main Window

The primary window SHALL be:

```text
HermesMainForm
```

Conceptual layout:

```text

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Target │ PID │ Architecture │ Access │ Mode │ Refresh │ CPU │ RAM   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The layout should be implemented using reusable panels rather than placing
hundreds of controls directly onto the form.

Never create a GUI whose purpose is to silently defeat Windows security,
AV/EDR, anti-cheat, authentication, protected processes, or third-party
security controls.

Each navigation item must open or activate an existing workspace rather than
creating unnecessary duplicate windows.

---

# 7. Dashboard

The Dashboard is the HERMES command center.

Display cards:

```text
Processes
Threads
Modules
DLLs
Memory Regions
Readable Regions
Writable Regions
Executable Regions
Guard Regions
Warnings

WARNING
ANOMALY
BLOCKED
EXITED
```

---

# 10. Memory Map

The memory map is one of the primary HERMES visualizations.

Display:

```text
Base Address
End Address
Size
State
Protection
Type
Allocation Base
Module
Region
Risk
Entropy
Hash
Status
```

Use a graphical memory-address visualization:

```text
LOW ADDRESS
│
├── IMAGE
├── READ ONLY
├── READ WRITE
├── PRIVATE
├── EXECUTABLE
├── GUARD
├── MAPPED
└── ...
│
HIGH ADDRESS
```

Allow zooming and selecting regions.

---

# 11. Memory-Zone Tabs

HERMES SHALL expose separate memory-zone tabs.

Required categories:

```text
Free
Read Only
Read Write
Page Guard
Shadow
Obfuscated
Mirrored
Execute
Execute Read
Execute Read Write
Confidential
Not Accessible
```

The UI must distinguish:

```text
NATIVE
DERIVED
HEURISTIC
SIMULATED
```

A derived concept such as "Shadow" or "Mirrored" must never be visually presented
as a native Windows memory protection type.

---

# 12. Hexadecimal Memory Viewer

The Hex Viewer is a core HERMES component.

Layout:

```text
Address       Hexadecimal Bytes                         ASCII
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
00007FF6...   48 8B 05 11 22 33 44 90 90 ...          H.."3D...

Features:

```text
address navigation
offset navigation
hex search
ASCII search
binary search
selection
copy
copy address
copy bytes
copy formatted bytes
follow address
bookmark
snapshot
compare
```

The raw byte array is the canonical source.

---

# 13. Typed Memory Inspector

The same bytes SHALL be graphically interpretable as:

```text
Byte
SByte
UInt16
Int16
UInt32
Int32
UInt64
Int64
Single
Double
Pointer
ASCII
UTF-8
UTF-16
Hex
Binary

Nibble
Offset
```

The UI must clearly show:

```text
RAW BYTES
↓
INTERPRETATION
↓
VALUE
```

Never maintain independent mutable copies of the same memory entry.

---

# 14. Memory Editor UI

The editor must visually separate:

```text
LIVE MEMORY
MIRROR
PROPOSED CHANGE
```

Recommended layout:

```text
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Required workflow:

```text
SELECT
→ INSPECT
→ PROPOSE
→ VALIDATE
→ CONFIRM
→ RECHECK
→ APPLY
→ READ BACK
→ VERIFY
→ AUDIT
```

Mirror editing must not automatically modify live memory. This follows the
existing hardened memory model.

---

# 15. Bit-Level Editor

Provide a visual binary editor:

```text
Bit 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
    1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

Show:

```text
Original

Requested
Result
```

Use the safe transformation model:

```text
Result =
(Original AND NOT Mask)
OR
(Requested AND Mask)
```

---

# 16. Pointer Inspector

The pointer interface SHALL display:

```text
Pointer
Address

 ├── Thread 101
 ├── Thread 102
 └── Thread 103
```

Suspension or other intrusive operations require explicit authorization and
must be visually marked as invasive.

---

# 19. Snapshot Manager

Snapshots SHALL have a dedicated tab.

Display:

```text
Snapshot ID
Process
Timestamp
Region Count
Module Count
Thread Count
Memory Size
Hash

MIRROR
  ├── Branch A
  ├── Branch B
  └── Branch C
```

Each branch is visually isolated.

Example:

```text

 └── Protection Change
```

A mirror modification must never silently reach live memory.

---

# 21. Differential Comparison

Use a three-column comparison:

```text
EXPECTED        LIVE          MIRROR
────────────────────────────────────────
AA BB CC        AA BB CC      AA BB CC
11 22 33        11 FF 33      11 22 44
```

Highlight:

```text
UNCHANGED
ADDED
REMOVED
MODIFIED
UNKNOWN
```

Display:

```text
Changed Bytes
Changed Regions
Changed Modules
Changed Protection
Changed Hashes
```

---

# 22. Live Telemetry

HERMES SHALL support live refresh without freezing the UI.

Telemetry components:

```text
CPU
RAM
Threads
Processes
Modules
Memory Reads
Memory Changes
Region Changes
Events
Errors
Operation Latency
```

Use:

```text
Task
Await
CancellationToken
IProgress
Timers
Buffered UI updates
```

Long-running scans must expose:

```text
Progress
Cancel
Status
Elapsed Time
Rate
Errors
```

This follows the existing requirement that memory operations not execute
synchronously on the UI thread.

---

# 23. Live Event Timeline

Timeline:

```text
16:01:01  Process Started
16:01:02  Module Loaded
16:01:03  Region Changed
16:01:04  Snapshot Created
16:01:05  Integrity Difference
16:01:06  Analysis Complete
```

Filters:

```text
Process
Memory
Module
Thread
Integrity
Warning
Error
User Action
System Event
```

---

# 24. Integrity Dashboard

Display:

```text
Process Identity
Executable Hash
Module Hashes
Memory Hashes
Region Baseline
Protection Baseline
Thread Baseline
Process Tree Baseline
```

Overall state:

```text
✓ TRUSTED
⚠ DRIFT
⚠ UNKNOWN
✕ INTEGRITY FAILURE
```

Never convert a heuristic result directly into a confirmed compromise.

The underlying skills explicitly require separation between native facts,
observations, derived states, heuristics, simulations, and verified findings.

---

# 25. Security Boundary Panel

If an operation is unavailable because of Windows security:

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SECURITY BOUNDARY                            │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Operation: Memory inspection                 │
│ Target: Protected Process                    │
│ Result: ACCESS DENIED                        │
│ Win32 Error: XXXXX                           │
│                                              │
│ HERMES RESPONSE                              │
│ ✓ Boundary detected                          │
│ ✓ Failure recorded                           │
│ ✓ Safe observation continues                 │
│ ✕ Automatic bypass disabled                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Never display:

```text
"Bypass successful"
```

unless the operation is a safe simulation in a designated laboratory model.

---

# 26. Attack / Defense Simulation UI

Capabilities from adversarial skills should be exposed through a simulation
workspace.

Layout:

```text
ATTACK MODEL
     ↓
OBSERVABLE EFFECT
     ↓
DETECTION
     ↓
PREVENTION
     ↓
CONTAINMENT
     ↓
RECOVERY
     ↓
VERIFICATION
```

Each scenario displays:

```text
Scenario
Target
Preconditions
Expected Effect
Observed Effect
Detection
Latency
Prevention
Containment
Recovery
Evidence
Result
```

Use simulated or explicitly authorized laboratory targets.

The defensive training skill defines this attack-to-detection-to-recovery
pipeline.

---

# 27. Analysis Workspace

Provide a multi-document analysis environment.

Tabs:

```text
Memory Analysis
PE Analysis
Pointer Analysis
Entropy
XOR Analysis
Mirror Analysis
Integrity
Timeline
Process Relationships
```

Each analyzer must provide:

```text
Input
Method
Result
Confidence
Evidence
Export
```

---

# 28. XOR / Transformation Viewer

Display:

```text
Original Bytes
Transformation
Key
Result
Entropy
Pattern
Confidence
```

For example:

```text
RAW
AA BB CC DD

TRANSFORMATION
XOR

KEY
5A

RESULT
F0 E1 96 87
```

This is an analysis visualization, not a mechanism for evading security
products.

---

# 29. Search Interface

Global search should support:

```text
Address
Hex
Byte
String
ASCII
UTF-8
UTF-16
Int8
UInt8
Int16
UInt16
Int32
UInt32
Int64
UInt64
Float
Double
Pointer
Offset
```

Search controls:

```text
Process
Region
Module
Address Range
Type
Alignment
Protection
Case Sensitivity
Exact Match
Wildcard
Regex
```

Results grid:

```text
Address
Region
Module
Representation
Value
Bytes
Confidence
```

---

# 30. Context Menus

Every major object should have a context menu.

Process:

```text
Inspect
Memory
Modules
Threads
Snapshot
Integrity
Properties
```

Region:

```text
Inspect
Hex View
Typed View
Snapshot
Compare
Hash
Pointer Analysis
```

Module:

```text
Inspect
PE
Sections
Imports
Exports
Hash
Memory Mapping
Compare
```

Memory entry:

```text
Inspect
Hex
Typed Value
Pointer
Snapshot
Compare
Propose Edit
```

---

# 31. Multiple Windows

HERMES SHALL support multiple independent analytical windows.

Examples:

```text
Main HERMES
 ├── Memory Window
 ├── Module Window
 ├── PE Window
 ├── Hex Window
 ├── Search Window
 ├── Snapshot Window
 ├── Timeline Window
 ├── Integrity Window
 └── Simulation Window
```

Windows must remember:

```text
position
size
dock state
selected process
selected tab
column widths
sort order
filters
```

Avoid opening duplicate instances when an existing document can be activated.

---

# 32. Docking Model

Preferred docking regions:

```text
LEFT
Navigation

CENTER
Primary Workspace

RIGHT
Inspector / Properties

BOTTOM
Logs / Events / Telemetry

FLOATING
Secondary analysis windows
```

Panels must be collapsible.

Keyboard shortcuts should provide:

```text
Ctrl+1 Dashboard
Ctrl+2 Processes
Ctrl+3 Memory
Ctrl+4 Modules
Ctrl+5 Threads
Ctrl+F Search
Ctrl+S Snapshot
F5 Refresh
Esc Cancel
```

---

# 33. Sci-Fi Visual System

The visual system SHALL use a consistent design language.

Recommended palette concept:

```text
Background       near-black
Panel            dark graphite
Primary          electric cyan
Secondary        violet
Success          green
Warning          amber
Critical         red
Text             cool white
Muted            gray-blue
```

Do not hard-code colors throughout individual controls.

Create:

```text
HermesTheme
HermesPalette
HermesTypography
HermesMetrics
HermesIcons
```

Centralize all visual constants.

---

# 34. Typography

Use a clean technical font where available.

Hierarchy:

```text
H1  HERMES
H2  WORKSPACE
H3  PANEL
BODY DATA
MONOSPACE MEMORY
```

Memory values should use a monospace font.

Recommended:

```text
Cascadia Mono
Consolas
```

Fallback safely when unavailable.

---

# 35. Visual Indicators

Create reusable indicators:

```text
StatusBadge
IntegrityBadge
ProcessBadge
ProtectionBadge
MemoryTypeBadge
WarningBadge
OperationBadge
LiveIndicator
ProgressIndicator
```

Examples:

```text
● LIVE
● MONITORING
● VERIFIED
● BLOCKED
● SIMULATION
● UNKNOWN
```

---

# 36. Graphical Memory Heatmap

Create a memory heatmap based on region metadata.

Possible dimensions:

```text
Protection
Size
Activity
Entropy
Modification Rate
Risk
```

Example:

```text
ADDRESS SPACE

████████████████
██░░░░██▓▓▓▓████
██░░░░██▓▓▓▓████
███████▒▒▒▒█████
```

The visualization must include a legend.

---

# 37. Memory Activity Graph

Display:

```text
Time
Bytes Read
Regions Changed
Modules Changed
Protection Changes
Integrity Events
```

Support:

```text
1 second
5 seconds
30 seconds
1 minute
5 minutes
custom
```

---

# 38. Responsive UI Rules

The GUI MUST remain responsive during:

```text
process enumeration
module enumeration
memory enumeration
memory scanning
snapshot generation
hashing
comparison
pointer analysis
PE analysis
large exports
```

Never perform expensive operations directly inside UI event handlers.

Use cancellation.

If the user presses:

```text
CANCEL
```

the operation must stop at a safe cancellation boundary.

---

# 39. Virtualized Data Grids

Large memory/process datasets must not create millions of ordinary WinForms
controls.

Use:

```text
VirtualMode
paging
incremental loading
buffered rendering
lazy detail loading
```

Memory viewers must render only the visible range whenever practical.

---

# 40. Status Bar

The bottom status bar must show:

```text
HERMES
Target
PID
Architecture
Mode
Access
Memory
Operation
Progress
CPU
RAM
Connection
```

Example:

```text
HERMES │ notepad.exe │ PID 4212 │ x64 │ OBSERVE │
MEMORY 82% │ READY │ CPU 14% │ RAM 5.2 GB
```

---

# 41. Modes

The GUI SHALL expose:

```text
OBSERVE
PROTECT
CONTAIN
RECOVER
FORENSIC
LABORATORY
SIMULATION
```

The selected mode must be visible at all times.

Example:

```text
MODE: SIMULATION
```

Use a prominent mode badge.

---

# 42. Edit Authorization UX

Editing must never be hidden.

Before a live authorized modification, show:

```text
TARGET
PROCESS IDENTITY
ADDRESS
REGION
ORIGINAL BYTES
EXPECTED BYTES
PROPOSED BYTES
PROTECTION
TYPE
LENGTH
REASON
AUTHORIZATION
```

Buttons:

```text
CANCEL
BACK
VALIDATE
CONFIRM
```

The final action should never be an ambiguous:

```text
OK
```

Prefer:

```text
CONFIRM AUTHORIZED CHANGE
```

---

# 43. Audit Viewer

The audit UI SHALL expose:

```text
Audit ID
Timestamp
Target
Process Identity
Module
Region
Address
Length
Operation
Original Hash
New Hash
Authorization
Result
Verification
Rollback
```

Sensitive raw memory should not be unnecessarily displayed.

The existing security model requires invasive actions to produce detailed audit
records.

---

# 44. Error Presentation

Never expose raw exceptions as the primary UI.

Instead:

```text
Operation Failed

Operation:
Read Memory

Target:
Process.exe

Address:
0x000001...

Error:
ACCESS_DENIED

Explanation:
The selected process does not permit the requested access.

Recovery:
Continue observation or select an authorized laboratory target.
```

Provide:

```text
Copy Details
Open Log
Retry
Cancel
```

Do not retry indefinitely.

---

# 45. Notifications

Use non-modal notifications for ordinary events:

```text
Snapshot created
Refresh complete
Analysis finished
Export complete
```

Use modal confirmation only for:

```text
destructive operation
security-sensitive operation
loss of unsaved work
explicit live modification
```

---

# 46. Settings

Settings UI:

```text
Appearance
Theme
Font
Refresh Rate
Memory View
Grid
Telemetry
Logging
Audit
Performance
Keyboard
Workspace
Security
```

Appearance:

```text
Sci-Fi Dark
Dark
High Contrast
System
```

Performance:

```text
UI Refresh Interval
Telemetry Interval
Maximum Visible Rows
Snapshot Buffer
Worker Count
```

---

# 47. Accessibility

Even with a sci-fi theme, HERMES must support:

```text
keyboard navigation
high contrast
tooltips
accessible names
visible focus
scalable fonts
non-color status indicators
```

Never communicate a security state solely through color.

Bad:

```text
red = danger
```

Good:

```text
✕ CRITICAL — Integrity mismatch
```

---

# 48. Tooltips

Every non-obvious button must have a tooltip.

Example:

```text
Create Snapshot
Capture the currently observed process state without modifying it.
```

For blocked controls:

```text
Unavailable:
The selected target does not satisfy the authorization policy.
```

---

# 49. Empty States

Every empty panel needs an explanation.

Example:

```text
NO PROCESS SELECTED

Select an authorized process from the Processes panel
to begin inspection.
```

Memory:

```text
NO MEMORY REGION SELECTED

Select a region from Memory Map.
```

---

# 50. Loading States

Never display a frozen panel.

Display:

```text
Enumerating memory...
████████████░░░░░░ 67%

Regions: 14,821
Readable: 11,304
Skipped: 1,202
Elapsed: 00:03.42

[CANCEL]
```

---

# 51. Real-Time Refresh

Live panels should use controlled refresh intervals.

Never repaint the entire application for every event.

Use:

```text
data batching
change detection
diff updates
virtualized rendering
throttled refresh
```

---

# 52. Data Consistency

All graphical representations must originate from shared models.

Preferred architecture:

```text
MemoryEntry
 ├── Raw Bytes
 ├── Address
 ├── Region
 ├── Protection
 ├── Module
 └── Interpretations
       ├── Hex
       ├── Integer
       ├── Float
       ├── Double
       ├── ASCII
       └── Pointer
```

The existing hardened skill explicitly establishes this shared underlying
model instead of independent mutable copies.

---

# 53. Component Library

The Copilot should create reusable HERMES controls:

```text
HermesMainMenu
HermesToolbar
HermesNavigation
HermesTabHost
HermesPanel
HermesDataGrid
HermesHexViewer
HermesMemoryMap
HermesPropertyGrid
HermesStatusBar
HermesChart
HermesTimeline
HermesLogViewer
HermesSearchBox
HermesCommandBar
HermesBadge
HermesCard
HermesDialog
HermesProgress
HermesNotification
HermesInspector
HermesTree
HermesMemoryHeatmap
```

Do not duplicate rendering code between forms.

---

# 54. Form Library

Required forms:

```text
MainForm.vb
ProcessSelectorForm.vb
ProcessDetailsForm.vb
MemoryMapForm.vb
MemoryViewerForm.vb
HexViewerForm.vb
TypedMemoryForm.vb
MemoryEditForm.vb
ConfirmEditForm.vb
ModuleExplorerForm.vb
PEInspectorForm.vb
ThreadExplorerForm.vb
SearchForm.vb
PointerAnalysisForm.vb
SnapshotForm.vb
MirrorForm.vb
IntegrityForm.vb
TimelineForm.vb
SimulationForm.vb
AuditForm.vb
SettingsForm.vb
AboutForm.vb
```

---

# 55. Control Library

Required controls:

```text
MemoryGridControl
MemoryMapControl
HexGridControl
TypedValueControl
ProcessGridControl
ModuleGridControl
ThreadGridControl
RegionGridControl
TimelineControl
TelemetryChartControl
IntegrityCardControl
NavigationControl
InspectorControl
AuditGridControl
SearchControl
FilterControl
```

---

# 56. Project Architecture

Recommended structure:

```text
HERMES/
│
├── HERMES.sln
│
├── src/
│   └── HERMES/
│       ├── HERMES.vbproj
│       ├── Program.vb
│       │
│       ├── Forms/
│       ├── Controls/
│       ├── Themes/
│       ├── Icons/
│       ├── Models/
│       ├── ViewModels/
│       ├── Services/
│       ├── Visualization/
│       ├── Dialogs/
│       ├── Modules/
│       ├── Security/
│       ├── Analysis/
│       └── Resources/
│
└── tests/
```

The GUI layer must not contain low-level native declarations.

Centralize Win32 interop in the native abstraction layer. The hardened skill
specifically requires P/Invoke definitions to remain centralized.

---

# 57. AI Copilot Operating Instruction

When the user gives only:

```text
create HERMES
```

interpret it as:

```text
CREATE THE HERMES PROJECT
```

Then construct the project according to this skill and all compatible
project skills.

The Copilot must understand that HERMES is the graphical shell connecting:

```text
Process
+
Thread
+
Module
+
DLL
+
PE
+
Memory
+
Memory Zones
+
Hex
+
Typed Data
+
Pointer Analysis
+
Snapshots
+
Mirrors
+
Integrity
+
Telemetry
+
Forensics
+
Simulation
+
Audit
```

The user should not need to repeat the complete GUI requirements every time.

---

# 58. Copilot Generation Rule

When generating a file:

```text
1. Determine the file's architectural role.
2. Inspect dependencies.
3. Preserve existing public APIs.
4. Generate complete compilable VB.NET.
5. Follow HERMES visual language.
6. Use reusable controls.
7. Avoid duplicated state.
8. Handle UI-thread rules.
9. Handle errors.
10. Preserve security boundaries.
```

Never generate:

```text
TODO
placeholder
fake API
invented API
unimplemented event
empty method pretending to work
hard-coded runtime result
fake live telemetry
fake memory contents presented as real
```

---

# 59. Visual Truthfulness

HERMES must never visually fake live information.

Never display:

```text
LIVE MEMORY
```

when the data is actually simulated.

Instead display:

```text
SIMULATION
```

Never display:

```text
VERIFIED
```

when the value is merely heuristic.

Use:

```text
OBSERVED
DERIVED
HEURISTIC
SIMULATED
UNCONFIRMED
VERIFIED
```

---

# 60. Real Data Indicator

When HERMES receives actual target data:

```text
● LIVE DATA
```

When data comes from a snapshot:

```text
● SNAPSHOT
```

When data comes from a mirror:

```text
● MIRROR
```

When data comes from simulation:

```text
● SIMULATION
```

The indicator must appear in the relevant viewer.

---

# 61. Performance Dashboard

Provide:

```text
UI FPS
Refresh Rate
Worker Activity
Queue Length
Memory Usage
GC Activity
Native Handles
Active Scans
Average Scan Time
Last Operation
```

This allows the Copilot to diagnose graphical performance rather than merely
adding more controls.

---

# 62. Graphical Diagnostics

Add a diagnostics window:

```text
UI
 ├── FPS
 ├── Paint Time
 ├── Layout Time
 ├── Control Count
 └── Memory

ENGINE
 ├── Operation Queue
 ├── Active Tasks
 ├── Latency
 └── Errors

DATA
 ├── Regions
 ├── Modules
 ├── Entries
 └── Cache
```

---

# 63. Layout Persistence

Persist:

```text
window position
window size
dock layout
active tabs
selected columns
column widths
sort settings
filters
theme
font
refresh settings
```

Do not persist sensitive raw memory unnecessarily.

---

# 64. Export System

Every major visualization should support:

```text
Copy
CSV
JSON
TXT
HTML
Report
```

Memory exports must clearly state:

```text
LIVE
SNAPSHOT
MIRROR
SIMULATION
```

---

# 65. Keyboard-First Design

All major functionality must be accessible through keyboard shortcuts.

Required:

```text
Ctrl+F       Search
Ctrl+G       Go to Address
Ctrl+S       Snapshot
Ctrl+Shift+S Export
F5            Refresh
Esc           Cancel
Ctrl+Tab      Next Tab
Ctrl+Shift+Tab Previous Tab
Ctrl+W        Close Workspace
Ctrl+1..9     Workspace navigation
```

---

# 66. Context-Aware Toolbar

The toolbar changes according to active workspace.

Memory:

```text
Refresh
Search
Go To
Snapshot
Compare
Typed View
Pointer
Edit
```

Modules:

```text
Refresh
PE
Sections
Imports
Exports
Hash
Compare
```

Process:

```text
Refresh
Inspect
Memory
Modules
Threads
Snapshot
Integrity
```

Simulation:

```text
New Scenario
Run
Pause
Stop
Reset
Compare
Export
```

---

# 67. Graphical Security State

Every operation has a state indicator:

```text
AVAILABLE
AUTHORIZED
VALIDATING
RUNNING
BLOCKED
FAILED
CANCELLED
VERIFIED
```

Use a state machine rather than changing button text unpredictably.

---

# 68. Safety UX

The GUI SHALL make unsafe or unauthorized actions difficult to perform
accidentally.

Use:

```text
explicit confirmation
target identity verification
expected-byte verification
operation preview
clear scope
audit preview
```

Never:

```text
hidden write
silent privilege escalation
silent security bypass
silent protection change
automatic retry against blocked security boundaries
```

---

# 69. Multi-Target Workspace

HERMES may display multiple authorized targets.

Workspace:

```text
TARGET A
TARGET B
TARGET C
```

Each target must retain its own:

```text
process identity
memory map
module set
snapshot state
analysis state
audit context
```

Never mix data between targets.

---

# 70. Comparison Workspace

Allow:

```text
Process A vs Process B
Snapshot A vs Snapshot B
Module A vs Module B
Memory A vs Memory B
Expected vs Live
Live vs Mirror
```

Visualize:

```text
MATCH
DIFFERENCE
MISSING
EXTRA
UNKNOWN
```

---

# 71. Sci-Fi Animation Rules

Animations should communicate state, not distract.

Allowed:

```text
subtle scan lines
live activity pulse
panel transitions
progress animations
graph movement
status glow
```

Avoid:

```text
excessive particle effects
constant flashing
slow transitions
animations during large scans
visual noise
```

Performance always takes priority over decoration.

---

# 72. Iconography

Every major subsystem receives a consistent icon:

```text
Dashboard       ◈
Process         ▣
Thread          ⧖
Module          ◫
Memory          ▤
Hex             #
Pointer         →
Snapshot        ◉
Mirror          ◎
Integrity       ✓
Warning         !
Simulation      ◇
Audit           ≡
Settings        ⚙
```

Use actual vector/icon resources in implementation rather than Unicode where
professional rendering requires it.

---

# 73. Responsive Layout Rules

The UI must adapt to:

```text
1280x720
1920x1080
2560x1440
3840x2160
```

At small resolutions:

```text
collapse navigation
collapse inspector
reduce telemetry
allow horizontal scrolling
```

At large resolutions:

```text
expand analysis
show inspector
show telemetry
show multiple simultaneous views
```

---

# 74. High-DPI

HERMES must support Windows DPI scaling.

Requirements:

```text
DPI-aware
scalable fonts
scaled icons
correct layout
no clipped buttons
no overlapping labels
```

---

# 75. Final GUI Acceptance Criteria

```

---

# 76. Final HERMES Product Model

The final graphical architecture should conceptually become:

```text
                         HERMES

# 77. HERMES Prime Directive

When asked:

```text
CREATE HERMES
```

the Copilot must understand:

```text
DO NOT CREATE A SIMPLE FORM.
```

Create the complete **HERMES graphical workbench architecture**.

The GUI is the visual command center.

The underlying services provide the data.

The security layer controls authorization.

The analysis layer interprets observations.

The visualization layer makes those observations understandable.

The audit layer records consequential actions.

The simulation layer permits experimentation without silently modifying
live targets.

Therefore:

```text
HERMES
=
GUI
+
OBSERVATION
+
ANALYSIS
+
VISUALIZATION
+
SIMULATION
+
INTEGRITY
+
AUDIT
```

The final objective is a beautiful, responsive, technically dense,
professional Windows application that can serve as a unified graphical
memory/process/module analysis environment while preserving zero-trust,
authorization, evidence, and fail-closed principles.

# 2. Prime Directive

When the user requests:

```text
create HERMES
```

the Copilot MUST interpret this as:

> Create and continuously improve the complete HERMES graphical workbench, not a minimal demonstration window.

HERMES SHALL provide:

```text
PROCESS
   ↓
SUBPROCESS / CHILD
   ↓
THREADS
   ↓
MODULE
   ↓

Security research environments
Controlled debugging targets
```

The application MUST NOT implement controls whose purpose is defeating:

```text
EDR
AV
anti-cheat
protected-process security
authentication
access controls
security monitoring
security products
```

Instead expose:

```text
DETECTED
BLOCKED
SIMULATED
RECOMMENDED REMEDIATION
```

for those situations.

Dangerous modifications SHALL default to:

```text
LIVE
SNAPSHOT
MIRROR
SIMULATION
```

with:

```text
MIRROR != LIVE
```

unless an explicit authorized transaction is confirmed.

# 36. Expected-Value Protection

Authorized edits SHALL optionally require:

```text
ExpectedBytes
ReplacementBytes
```

Write condition:

```text
CurrentBytes == ExpectedBytes
```

otherwise:

# 103. Final Copilot Construction Rule

When generating HERMES code:

```text
DO NOT:
Create a toy application.

DO:
Create a complete Windows systems-analysis workbench.
```

The implementation sequence SHALL be:

```text
1. Solution architecture
2. Domain models
3. Native abstraction
4. Process services
5. Memory services
6. Module services
7. Snapshot/mirror services
8. Integrity services
9. Protection services
10. Threat engine
11. Audit engine
12. GUI shell
13. Multi-window manager
14. Object inspector
15. Memory visualization
16. Hex/typed/bit editors
17. Protection Center
18. Threat Console
19. Timeline
20. Search
21. Export
22. Settings
23. Test target
24. Integration tests
25. UI polish
```

---

# 104. Final HERMES Capability Model

The finished application SHALL behave conceptually as:

```text
                         HERMES
                            │
          ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
          │                 │                 │
       INSPECT           ANALYZE          PROTECT
          │                 │                 │

          └─────────────────┼─────────────────┘
                            │
                       CORRELATION
                            │
                    ┌───────┴────────┐
                    │                │
                 TIMELINE         THREATS
                    │                │
                    └───────┬────────┘
                            │
                       EVIDENCE
                            │
                   SNAPSHOT / MIRROR
                            │
                    AUDIT + REPORT
```

The central design principle is:

```text
INSPECT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE SAFELY OBSERVED
        ↓
CORRELATE EVERYTHING
        ↓
BASELINE IMPORTANT OBJECTS
        ↓
MONITOR CONTINUOUSLY
        ↓
DETECT CHANGES
        ↓
SHOW THE EVIDENCE
        ↓
PROTECT THE SELECTED OBJECT
        ↓
AUDIT EVERY SIGNIFICANT ACTION
```

HERMES SHALL therefore be a **graphical, multi-window, object-centric Windows memory/process/module inspection and integrity-protection workbench**, rather than merely a memory editor.

# Hardened Windows Memory Inspector / Editor

## 1. Mission

Act as a senior Windows systems engineer, Visual Basic .NET engineer,
reverse-engineering specialist, secure UI architect, and software-hardening
engineer.

Build the project:

```text
MemoryInspectorEditor
```

The application is a Windows desktop memory inspection and controlled editing
environment.

Primary objectives:

1. Inspect virtual memory of an explicitly authorized target process.
2. Enumerate Windows virtual-memory regions.
3. Classify regions according to protection/state/type.
4. Display live memory as hexadecimal and typed data.
5. Provide independent visualization tabs for memory classifications.
6. Search memory using multiple typed/address representations.
7. Provide explicit, auditable editing of writable memory.
8. Require confirmation before every destructive memory modification.
9. Provide XOR/deobfuscation analysis as a transformation of captured data.
10. Analyze pointers and offsets without silently modifying the target.
11. Detect suspicious or unusual memory mappings.
12. Maintain a clear distinction between:
    - observed facts,
    - inferred classifications,
    - simulated states,
    - requested modifications,
    - successfully committed modifications.

The agent must prioritize correctness, reproducibility, safety, and testability
over feature quantity.

---

# 2. Mandatory Development Protocol

The project MUST be developed:

```text
folder-by-folder
file-by-file
one complete file per output
```

When the user requests the next file:

1. Determine its exact location.
2. Determine its dependencies.
3. Produce the complete file.
4. Do not silently omit required sections.
5. Do not modify previously generated files unless explicitly requested.
6. Preserve compatibility with all previously generated files.
7. Identify compilation dependencies.
8. Identify required imports.
9. Identify required project references.
10. Identify required P/Invoke declarations.
11. Keep public APIs stable unless a deliberate revision is requested.

Do NOT output:

```text
partial pseudocode
...
TODO implementation
placeholder methods
"implementation omitted"
fake API calls
invented Windows APIs
uncompilable snippets
```

unless the user explicitly asks for a conceptual prototype.

---

# 3. Definition of Done

A file is considered complete only when:

```text
[ ] syntactically valid
[ ] compatible with project target framework
[ ] compatible with previously generated files
[ ] required imports present
[ ] required namespaces correct
[ ] nullable/reference handling considered
[ ] Win32 API declarations validated
[ ] error paths handled
[ ] cancellation considered where appropriate
[ ] resource disposal considered
[ ] UI-thread rules respected
[ ] security boundaries preserved
[ ] no accidental process-wide side effects
```

The complete project is considered finished only when:

```text
[ ] solution builds
[ ] project builds
[ ] no compiler errors
[ ] warnings reviewed
[ ] startup succeeds
[ ] process enumeration works
[ ] memory-map enumeration works
[ ] classification works
[ ] search works
[ ] read-only inspection works
[ ] writable editing is permission-checked
[ ] confirmation workflow works
[ ] failed writes are handled
[ ] inaccessible regions do not crash the application
[ ] XOR analysis works on captured data
[ ] pointer/offset analysis is bounded
[ ] UI remains responsive
[ ] cancellation works
[ ] logs are generated
```

Never claim:

```text
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
TESTS PASS
PROJECT COMPLETE
```

without appropriate evidence.

---

# 4. Security Boundary

The application operates only on:

```text
user-owned processes
authorized debugging targets
explicitly permitted test environments
```

The agent MUST implement functionality whose primary purpose is:

```text
credential theft
token theft
browser secret extraction
anti-cheat bypass
EDR bypass
AV bypass
security-product evasion
stealth injection
persistence
covert process hiding
kernel-rootkit behavior
malware deployment
remote unauthorized process manipulation
security-control circumvention
```

If a requested feature crosses this boundary, replace the implementation with
a safe defensive equivalent.

Example:

Instead of:

```text
bypass protected process security
```

implement:

```text
detect protected/inaccessible process
display access failure
record Windows error code
explain required authorization
```

Instead of:

```text
hide a mirrored memory region
```

implement:

```text
detect duplicate/mapped regions
display mapping relationship
calculate similarity
```

Instead of:

```text
bypass an anti-debug mechanism
```

implement:

```text
detect the condition
report the mechanism
provide defensive diagnostics
```

---

# 5. Architecture

Use a layered architecture.

```text
Presentation
    ↓
Controls
    ↓
Application Services
    ↓
Memory Abstraction
    ↓
Windows Native API
```

Recommended dependency direction:

```text
Forms
  ↓
Controls
  ↓
Services
  ↓
Models
  ↓
NativeMethods
```

Models MUST NOT depend on WinForms.

Native API declarations MUST remain centralized.

---

# 6. Project Structure

The canonical project structure is:

Additional files may be introduced when they improve security or maintainability.

Examples:

```text
Services/
    AuditLogService.vb
    MemorySnapshotService.vb
    PermissionService.vb
    ValidationService.vb

Security/
    ProcessAccessPolicy.vb
    EditAuthorization.vb
    IntegrityValidator.vb

Tests/
    ...
```

---

# 7. Memory-Zone Model

The UI shall expose independently selectable memory classifications.

Initial categories:

```text
1   Free
2   Read Only
3   Read Write
4   Page Guard
5   Shadow Zone
6   Obfuscated Zone
7   Mirrored Zone
8   Execute
9   Execute Read
10  Execute Read Write
11  Confidential
12  Not Accessible
```

Important:

Not every category is a native Windows memory-protection category.

Therefore distinguish:

```text
Native classification
Derived classification
Heuristic classification
User-defined classification
Simulated classification
```

For example:

```text
Free
```

may be directly obtained from virtual-memory enumeration.

But:

```text
Shadow Zone
Mirrored Zone
Obfuscated Zone
Confidential
```

must be explicitly marked as derived/heuristic unless a verified native
property establishes the classification.

Never present a heuristic as an OS fact.

---

# 8. Windows Memory Information

Use appropriate Windows virtual-memory APIs through centralized P/Invoke.

The implementation should model concepts such as:

```text
MEM_FREE
MEM_RESERVE
MEM_COMMIT

PAGE_NOACCESS
PAGE_READONLY
PAGE_READWRITE
PAGE_WRITECOPY
PAGE_EXECUTE
PAGE_EXECUTE_READ
PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE
PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY
PAGE_GUARD
PAGE_NOCACHE
PAGE_WRITECOMBINE
```

Also track:

```text
BaseAddress
AllocationBase
AllocationProtect
RegionSize
State
Protect
Type
```

Architecture must support:

```text
32-bit process
64-bit process
WOW64 process
current-process architecture
```

Do not truncate addresses.

Use an address representation capable of holding the full native pointer width.

---

# 9. Memory Entry Representation

Every displayed entry should support:

```text
Address
Hex
Data
String
Byte/Value
Byte Type
Address Entire
Short Address
Pointers
Offsets
```

Example conceptual row:

```text
Address:
0x000001A4F0001000

Hex:
48 65 6C 6C 6F

Data:
48 65 6C 6C 6F

String:
Hello

Byte/Value:
72 / 101 / 108 / 108 / 111

Byte Type:
Int8 / UInt8 / ASCII

Address Entire:
0x000001A4F0001000

Short Address:
0xF0001000

Pointers:
possible pointer interpretation

Offsets:
base-relative offset
```

A row must retain its original byte sequence so that transformations do not
silently overwrite the observed representation.

---

# 10. Data-Type Engine

Supported interpretations should include:

```text
Byte
SByte
UInt16
Int16
UInt32
Int32
UInt64
Int64
Single
Double
Pointer32
Pointer64
ASCII
UTF-8
UTF-16
Unicode
Hex
Binary
```

The same bytes may legitimately represent multiple values.

Therefore display:

```text
Raw bytes
+
interpretation
```

rather than claiming one interpretation is inherently correct.

---

# 11. Search System

Global shortcut:

```text
Ctrl+F
```

opens:

```text
SearchDialog
```

Supported search filters:

```text
Address
Hex
Data
String
Byte
Byte Type
Entire Address
Short Address
Pointer
Offset
```

The search engine must support:

```text
exact match
partial match
masked match
case-sensitive string search
case-insensitive string search
numeric comparison
hex comparison
pointer comparison
address range
```

Searches must be bounded.

Never scan the entire virtual address space indefinitely.

Use:

```text
CancellationToken
progress reporting
region filtering
maximum scan size
read failure recovery
```

---

# 12. Right-Click Editing

Right-clicking an editable memory entry opens the edit workflow.

The edit UI must support independent representations:

```text
Address
Hex
Data
String
Byte/Value
Byte Type/Value Type
Address Entire
Short Address
Pointer
Offset
```

The selected representation must be converted into a proposed byte sequence.

Workflow:

```text
Select memory
    ↓
Right-click
    ↓
Edit
    ↓
Choose representation
    ↓
Enter proposed value
    ↓
Validate
    ↓
Display old bytes
    ↓
Display new bytes
    ↓
Display affected address range
    ↓
Require explicit confirmation
    ↓
Check region permissions again
    ↓
Perform write
    ↓
Read back when possible
    ↓
Verify
    ↓
Audit result
```

Never modify memory merely because an edit dialog was opened.

---

# 13. Edit Safety

Before writing:

```text
[ ] target process still exists
[ ] process identity still matches
[ ] target address is valid
[ ] region still exists
[ ] region is committed
[ ] protection permits writing
[ ] requested byte count fits region
[ ] integer overflow is impossible
[ ] address range does not wrap
[ ] user explicitly confirmed
```

If the region is read-only:

```text
DO NOT silently change protection.
```

Instead report:

```text
Write denied because the current protection does not permit writing.
```

Any explicit protection-change functionality must be separately designed,
audited, permission-checked, and restricted to authorized debugging scenarios.

---

# 14. Double-Read Verification

Because another thread can modify target memory between inspection and editing,
use:

```text
read-before-edit
```

and where appropriate:

```text
compare expected bytes
write
read-after-write
verify
```

If the original bytes changed before the write:

```text
abort
```

unless the user explicitly chooses a fresh snapshot.

This prevents accidental writes based on stale data.

---

# 15. Memory Snapshot Model

Support immutable snapshots.

A snapshot contains:

```text
Process identity
PID
Process start identity when available
Timestamp
Architecture
Region information
Original bytes
Classification
```

Snapshots allow:

```text
compare A vs B
detect changed bytes
detect new regions
detect removed regions
detect protection changes
detect mapping changes
```

Snapshots should be preferred for expensive analysis.

---

# 16. Shadow-Zone Detection

"Shadow Zone" is a derived concept.

Do not pretend it is a native Windows memory type.

Possible defensive detection signals:

```text
duplicate content
overlapping mappings
copy-on-write regions
private vs mapped comparisons
same-page hashes
same-page hashes at different virtual addresses
```

Report:

```text
Native properties
+
reason for derived classification
+
confidence
```

Example:

```text
Classification:
Shadow Zone

Confidence:
0.87

Evidence:
same content hash observed at multiple mapped addresses
```

---

# 17. Mirrored-Zone Detection

A mirrored region is represented defensively as:

```text
Region A
Region B
Similarity
Address relationship
Protection relationship
Mapping metadata
```

Use:

```text
hash comparison
page comparison
region-size comparison
mapping metadata
```

Do not implement covert memory redirection.

Safe functionality:

```text
detect
compare
visualize
simulate
document
```

---

# 18. Obfuscated-Zone Detection

An "obfuscated zone" must be treated as a heuristic.

Potential signals:

```text
high byte entropy
repeating XOR relationships
known plaintext/ciphertext relationships
constant XOR masks
byte-frequency anomalies
```

Do not automatically claim:

```text
"This is XOR encrypted."
```

Instead:

```text
Possible XOR transformation detected.
Confidence: 0.xx
Candidate key: ...
```

---

# 19. XOR Analysis

The XOR tab shall provide:

```text
Input bytes
Candidate key
Key length
Repeated-key analysis
Single-byte XOR analysis
Known plaintext comparison
Output bytes
ASCII interpretation
Hex interpretation
Entropy before
Entropy after
```

The XOR engine should operate on:

```text
captured bytes
user-provided buffers
authorized target-process memory snapshots
```

Prefer non-destructive analysis.

The XOR result must not automatically write back to process memory.

---

# 20. Pointer Analysis

PointerScanner must support defensive analysis:

```text
potential pointer detection
32-bit pointers
64-bit pointers
alignment analysis
module-relative addresses
region-relative addresses
base + offset
pointer chain representation
```

Example:

```text
Base:
0x000001A400000000

Offset:
0x0012F0

Result:
0x000001A4000012F0
```

All arithmetic must use checked operations.

Reject:

```text
overflow
underflow
invalid pointer width
non-canonical addresses where applicable
```

Pointer analysis must be bounded by:

```text
maximum depth
maximum candidate count
maximum scan region
cancellation
```

---

# 21. Offset Analysis

Display:

```text
absolute address
region base
allocation base
module base
relative offset
```

Example:

```text
Address:
0x000001A400125000

Region Base:
0x000001A400100000

Offset:
0x25000
```

Do not assume an address is a module offset without evidence.

---

# 22. Reverse Engineering Features

The project may provide defensive reverse-engineering tools:

```text
memory maps
module enumeration
region comparison
snapshot comparison
byte-pattern search
pointer analysis
offset analysis
XOR analysis
mapping visualization
protection analysis
change detection
```

"BypassMethodsForm" must be renamed conceptually or functionally toward:

```text
DefensiveAnalysisForm
```

or:

```text
ProtectionAnalysisForm
```

if the original name encourages unsafe functionality.

The form may document:

```text
protection mechanism
observed behavior
diagnostic evidence
safe debugging approach
```

It must not provide operational instructions for defeating security controls.

---

# 23. UI Architecture

Main interface:

```text
Process Selector
        ↓
Main Memory Workspace
        ↓
Memory Zone Tabs
```

Initial tabs:

```text
Free
Read Only
Read Write
Page Guard
Shadow
Obfuscated
Mirrored
Execute
Execute Read
Execute Read Write
Confidential
Not Accessible
```

Each tab contains:

```text
toolbar
filter controls
memory grid
status bar
selection panel
data interpretation panel
```

---

# 24. Data Lists

The selected memory item must populate:

```text
List 1  Address
List 2  Hex
List 3  Data
List 4  String
List 5  Byte / Value
List 6  Byte Type / Value Type
List 7  Address Entire
List 8  Short Address
List 9  Pointers
List 10 Offsets
```

These are views over the same underlying `MemoryEntry`.

Do not maintain ten independent copies of mutable state.

Preferred model:

```text
MemoryEntry
   ├── raw bytes
   ├── address
   ├── region
   └── calculated interpretations
```

---

# 25. Threading

Memory scans MUST NOT execute synchronously on the UI thread.

Use:

```text
Async
Await
Task
CancellationToken
IProgress(Of T)
```

UI updates must occur on the UI synchronization context.

Long operations must expose:

```text
progress
cancel
status
errors
```

---

# 26. Native API Rules

All P/Invoke definitions belong in:

```text
Modules/NativeMethods.vb
```

Do not scatter Win32 declarations through forms.

Use explicit structures with correct packing and pointer-sized types.

Avoid:

```text
Integer
```

for native pointers.

Prefer:

```text
IntPtr
UIntPtr
Long
ULong
```

depending on the API contract.

Use `SetLastError:=True` where appropriate and capture errors immediately after
failed native calls.

---

# 27. Resource Management

Every native resource must have an ownership rule.

Examples:

```text
process handle
module handle
memory buffers
streams
timers
cancellation registrations
graphics resources
```

Use:

```text
SafeHandle
IDisposable
Using
Try...Finally
```

where appropriate.

Never leak process handles during repeated scans.

---

# 28. Process Identity

Do not trust PID alone for long-lived sessions.

Track:

```text
PID
process name
architecture
start-time identity where available
```

Before editing, verify the process still corresponds to the selected target.

If the PID has been reused:

```text
abort operation
require re-selection
```

---

# 29. Access Rights

Request the minimum process rights necessary.

Separate:

```text
inspection access
editing access
```

Do not automatically request maximum privileges.

Example conceptual model:

```text
Inspection:
query information
read memory

Editing:
query information
read memory
write memory
operation-specific permissions
```

If inspection works but editing is denied:

```text
inspection remains available
editing remains disabled
```

---

# 30. Error Handling

Never allow one inaccessible region to terminate the entire scan.

Expected failures include:

```text
ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED
ERROR_PARTIAL_COPY
invalid address
region changed
process exited
handle closed
protection changed
race condition
WOW64 mismatch
architecture mismatch
```

Handle failures per region where possible.

The UI should report:

```text
operation
address
region
Win32 error
message
recoverability
```

---

# 31. Audit Logging

Every modification must generate an audit record.

Record:

```text
timestamp
PID
process identity
address
region
old bytes
new bytes
representation selected
user confirmation
write result
read-back verification
error if any
```

Never log:

```text
credentials
tokens
private secrets
unnecessary process contents
```

Audit logs should minimize sensitive memory disclosure.

---

# 32. Editing Transactions

Represent edits internally as:

```text
MemoryEditTransaction
```

Conceptual state machine:

```text
Created
    ↓
Validated
    ↓
Confirmed
    ↓
PreconditionChecked
    ↓
WriteAttempted
    ↓
Verified
```

Failure states:

```text
Rejected
Cancelled
PreconditionFailed
WriteFailed
VerificationFailed
```

Never represent an unverified write as successful.

---

# 33. Validation

Every externally supplied value must be validated.

Examples:

```text
address
hex string
integer
float
double
pointer
offset
string encoding
XOR key
region size
scan size
search pattern
```

Reject malformed values before native API invocation.

---

# 34. Integer Safety

Use checked arithmetic for:

```text
address + size
base + offset
pointer + offset
region end
scan end
buffer size
```

Never allow integer wraparound to create an unintended address.

---

# 35. Memory Bounds

Before reading:

```text
requestedAddress >= regionBase
requestedAddress < regionEnd
requestedAddress + requestedSize <= regionEnd
```

Use overflow-safe calculations.

If a request crosses regions:

```text
split safely
```

or reject it.

---

# 36. Performance

The application should avoid:

```text
one ReadProcessMemory call per byte
```

Prefer bounded region/page reads.

Recommended concepts:

```text
chunked reads
page-aligned reads
buffer reuse
incremental rendering
virtualized grid
background scanning
cancellation
hash caching
```

Do not load gigabytes of process memory into the UI at once.

---

# 37. UI Responsiveness

The UI must remain responsive while:

```text
enumerating processes
enumerating memory
reading memory
searching
hashing
pointer scanning
snapshot comparison
XOR analysis
```

Use progress reporting.

Example:

```text
Scanning:
37%

Region:
0x000001A400000000
Size:
0x0000000000200000
```

---

# 38. Search Optimization

Search engine stages:

```text
1. Filter regions
2. Filter protection/state
3. Read bounded chunks
4. Search byte patterns
5. Interpret matches
6. Produce MemoryEntry results
7. Stop/cancel when requested
```

Do not repeatedly reinterpret the same bytes unnecessarily.

---

# 39. Hashing

For memory comparison, use cryptographic hashes where integrity matters.

Possible algorithms:

```text
SHA-256
SHA-512
```

For fast non-security comparisons, a faster non-cryptographic hash may be used,
but it must never be described as an integrity guarantee.

---

# 40. Confidential Classification

"Confidential" is not a standard Windows memory protection flag.

Treat it as:

```text
derived classification
```

Possible evidence:

```text
user-defined address range
application metadata
known sensitive-region classification
explicit configuration
```

Do not automatically inspect sensitive regions merely because they are
classified as confidential.

---

# 41. Not Accessible Classification

Represent inaccessible regions explicitly.

Example:

```text
State:
Reserved

Protection:
NoAccess

Readable:
False

Reason:
PAGE_NOACCESS
```

Do not repeatedly hammer inaccessible memory.

---

# 42. Guard Pages

PAGE_GUARD must be represented as a special protection condition.

Reading a guard page can have side effects or fail.

Therefore:

```text
detect
display
warn
```

before attempting access.

Guard pages should not automatically be scanned.

---

# 43. Execute Memory

Executable regions must be displayed according to their native protection.

Examples:

```text
Execute
Execute Read
Execute Read Write
Execute Write Copy
```

The application may display:

```text
Executable: Yes
Writable: No
Readable: Yes
```

Do not automatically modify executable memory.

---

# 44. Configuration

Configuration should define:

```text
maximum scan size
maximum search results
maximum pointer depth
maximum pointer candidates
read chunk size
snapshot size
logging level
confirmation policy
UI refresh interval
```

Safe defaults must be conservative.

---

# 45. Confirmation Dialog

The confirmation window should display:

```text
TARGET PROCESS
PID

ADDRESS
REGION

OLD VALUE
NEW VALUE

OLD HEX
NEW HEX

BYTE COUNT

PROTECTION

WARNING:
This operation modifies live process memory.
```

Buttons:

```text
Confirm Edit
Cancel
```

Default focus:

```text
Cancel
```

Do not make destructive actions the default button.

---

# 46. Fail-Closed Editing

If any required precondition cannot be established:

```text
DO NOT WRITE
```

Examples:

```text
unknown process identity
unknown region
unknown protection
stale selection
overflow
invalid conversion
confirmation missing
permission denied
read-back mismatch
```

Inspection may continue where safe.

---

# 47. Simulation Mode

Provide a safe simulation mode.

Simulation can model:

```text
memory mirror
pointer redirection
offset transformation
XOR transformation
protection transitions
memory edits
```

without modifying a real process.

This is the preferred environment for testing advanced analysis features.

---

# 48. Test Architecture

Tests should include:

```text
DataConverterTests
SearchEngineTests
PointerScannerTests
XorEngineTests
MemoryZoneTests
MemoryEntryTests
AddressArithmeticTests
ValidationTests
```

Integration tests should use a dedicated test process owned by the test suite.

Do not use arbitrary third-party processes as automated test targets.

---

# 49. Test Process

Create a deterministic test process capable of exposing known data.

Example conceptual memory:

```text
ASCII:
HELLO_MEMORY

UTF-16:
MemoryInspector

Integers:
12345678

Floating point:
3.1415926535

Pointer-like values:
known test addresses

XOR data:
known plaintext + known key
```

The test process should allow deterministic verification.

---

# 50. Regression Testing

After every architectural change:

```text
build
unit tests
startup test
inspection test
search test
edit simulation test
XOR test
pointer test
error-path test
```

For native memory operations:

```text
verify both success and failure paths
```

---

# 51. Warning Policy

Warnings must never be hidden merely to obtain a clean build.

For each warning:

```text
identify
classify
fix if legitimate
document if unavoidable
```

Do not use broad suppression such as:

```text
/noWarn:*
```

or equivalent global suppression to conceal problems.

---

# 52. Code Quality

Prefer:

```text
Option Strict On
Option Explicit On
Option Infer On
```

Use explicit types when ambiguity could affect correctness.

Avoid:

```text
On Error Resume Next
```

except for narrowly justified compatibility cases.

Prefer structured exception handling.

---

# 53. Logging

Logging levels:

```text
Trace
Debug
Information
Warning
Error
Critical
```

Never log raw memory by default.

For memory values, prefer:

```text
length
hash
small bounded preview
```

rather than dumping entire buffers.

---

# 54. Agent Behavior

The coding agent MUST:

```text
inspect current architecture
respect existing files
avoid duplicate classes
avoid duplicate P/Invoke definitions
avoid namespace drift
avoid API invention
avoid unnecessary refactoring
avoid speculative dependencies
```

Before introducing a new class:

```text
search existing project
check whether equivalent functionality exists
```

Before changing a public interface:

```text
identify consumers
update dependent files
rebuild
```

---

# 55. Evidence Discipline

For every important claim:

```text
Claim
Evidence
Result
```

Examples:

```text
Claim:
Memory enumeration works.

Evidence:
Integration test successfully enumerated regions in the deterministic test process.

Result:
Confirmed.
```

If not tested:

```text
Status:
Not confirmed.
```

Never convert:

```text
"It looks correct"
```

into:

```text
"Tested successfully"
```

---

# 56. Completion Gate

When all required features are implemented:

STOP adding optional features.

Run:

```text
clean build
full build
unit tests
integration tests
startup test
functional smoke test
error-path tests
```

Then classify each requirement:

```text
PASS
FAIL
NOT CONFIRMED
NOT APPLICABLE
```

The agent must not declare completion while mandatory requirements remain
unverified.

---

# 57. File-by-File Output Contract

When the user says:

```text
next file
```

return exactly one requested source/configuration file.

Recommended format:

```text
PATH:
src/MemoryInspectorEditor/Classes/MemoryZone.vb

PURPOSE:
Memory-region model.

DEPENDENCIES:
...

CONTENT:
<complete file>
```

Do not output another project file unless requested.

When the user says:

```text
next
```

continue from the next file in the canonical project map.

---

# 58. Initial File Order

Use this order unless dependency analysis requires a different order:

```text
01 Program.vb

02 MainForm.vb
03 MainForm.Designer.vb
04 SearchDialog.vb
05 EditDialog.vb
06 ConfirmEditDialog.vb
07 XorDeobfuscateForm.vb
08 BypassMethodsForm.vb
09 ProcessSelectorForm.vb

10 MemoryGridControl.vb
11 DataListPanel.vb
12 FilterPanel.vb

13 MemoryZone.vb
14 MemoryEntry.vb
15 MemoryInspector.vb
16 MemoryEditor.vb
17 ProcessManager.vb
18 SearchEngine.vb
19 PointerScanner.vb
20 XorEngine.vb
21 MirrorEngine.vb
22 BypassEngine.vb
23 DataConverter.vb

24 MemoryZoneKind.vb
25 DataTypeKind.vb
26 SearchFilterType.vb

27 NativeMethods.vb
28 Constants.vb

29 MemoryInspectorEditor.vbproj
30 App.config
31 Settings.settings
32 Resources.resx
33 README.md
34 MemoryInspectorEditor.sln
```

However, if compilation dependencies require models/enums/native definitions
before forms, the agent may generate foundational files first while preserving
the user's one-file-per-output rule.

---

# 59. Required Advanced Security Properties

The final implementation should incorporate:

```text
least privilege
fail closed
bounded memory operations
checked arithmetic
process identity validation
stale-region detection
double-read verification
explicit confirmation
audit logging
read-back verification
cancellation
resource disposal
native error propagation
architecture awareness
WOW64 awareness
race-condition awareness
UI isolation
snapshot integrity
```

---

# 60. Defensive Reverse-Engineering Model

Use this conceptual pipeline:

```text
OBSERVE
   ↓
CLASSIFY
   ↓
SNAPSHOT
   ↓
COMPARE
   ↓
ANALYZE
   ↓
SIMULATE
   ↓
VALIDATE
   ↓
OPTIONALLY EDIT
   ↓
VERIFY
   ↓
AUDIT
```

Never:

```text
OBSERVE
   ↓
AUTOMATICALLY BYPASS
   ↓
AUTOMATICALLY MODIFY
```

---

# 61. Truthfulness Rule

The agent must distinguish:

```text
Native Windows fact
Derived observation
Heuristic
Simulation
User-provided interpretation
Unverified hypothesis
```

Example:

```text
PAGE_READWRITE
```

is a native protection fact.

```text
Mirrored Zone
```

is a derived classification unless backed by verified mapping evidence.

```text
Possible XOR
```

is a hypothesis until validated.

---

# 62. Final Engineering Principle

The application should behave like a professional diagnostic debugger:

```text
READ CAREFULLY
UNDERSTAND FIRST
MODIFY ONLY WHEN AUTHORIZED
VERIFY BEFORE WRITING
VERIFY AFTER WRITING
LOG WHAT HAPPENED
FAIL SAFELY
```

The agent's priority order is:

```text
1. Correctness
2. Safety
3. Evidence
4. Stability
5. Security
6. Maintainability
7. Performance
8. Feature breadth
```

Never sacrifice the first five for the last three.

---

# 63. Final Completion Statement

Only after successful verification may the agent state:

```text
PROJECT COMPLETE

Build:
PASS

Tests:
PASS

Startup:
PASS

Memory Enumeration:
PASS

Search:
PASS

Inspection:
PASS

Controlled Editing:
PASS

Confirmation:
PASS

Read-Back Verification:
PASS

XOR Analysis:
PASS

Pointer/Offset Analysis:
PASS

Error Handling:
PASS

Security Validation:
PASS
```

If any mandatory item lacks evidence, state:

```text
PROJECT NOT YET VERIFIED
```

and identify the exact remaining requirement.
---

# 63. Protected-Memory Access and Management Principles

## 63.1 Objective

The memory engine must treat protected memory as a distinct security boundary.

The system must be capable of:

```text
detect
classify
inspect when authorized
diagnose access failures
manage access permissions legitimately
simulate protected states
edit only when explicitly authorized
verify every modification
```

The system must NOT silently circumvent Windows security boundaries.

---

# 64. Protected Memory State Machine

Every memory region should have an explicit access state:

```text
UNKNOWN
    ↓
ENUMERATED
    ↓
CLASSIFIED
    ↓
ACCESS_TESTED
    ↓
READABLE
    ↓
EDITABLE
```

Failure states:

```text
ACCESS_DENIED
NOT_COMMITTED
NO_ACCESS
GUARD_PAGE
INVALID_REGION
PROCESS_EXITED
STALE_REGION
ARCHITECTURE_MISMATCH
PROTECTION_CHANGED
```

Never infer:

```text
"not readable"
```

to mean:

```text
"bypass required"
```

Instead determine the actual Windows protection/access condition.

---

# 65. Access Principle — Least Privilege

The application must request the minimum process access required.

Separate capabilities:

```text
PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION
PROCESS_VM_READ
PROCESS_VM_WRITE
PROCESS_VM_OPERATION
```

Do not request maximum access merely because it is convenient.

Recommended model:

```text
Inspection Mode:
    QUERY
    VM_READ

Editing Mode:
    QUERY
    VM_READ
    VM_WRITE
    VM_OPERATION
```

Editing permissions must not automatically be enabled merely because a process
was selected.

---

# 66. Authorization Gate

Before protected-memory operations:

```text
Target Process
      ↓
Identity Verification
      ↓
Access Policy
      ↓
Requested Operation
      ↓
Permission Check
      ↓
Operation
      ↓
Verification
      ↓
Audit
```

The authorization object should conceptually contain:

```text
AuthorizedProcess
ProcessId
ProcessIdentity
RequestedCapability
ReadAllowed
WriteAllowed
Timestamp
Expiration
Reason
```

An authorization must be associated with the current process identity rather
than only its PID.

---

# 67. Protected-Zone Classification

Classify regions using verified native information:

```text
State
Protect
Type
RegionSize
AllocationBase
AllocationProtect
```

Derived classifications must remain separate:

```text
NativeProtection
DerivedClassification
HeuristicConfidence
Evidence
```

Example:

```text
Native:
PAGE_READONLY

Derived:
Possible Shadow Zone

Confidence:
0.82

Evidence:
duplicate page content observed elsewhere
```

Never replace the native protection value with a heuristic label.

---

# 68. Protected Zone Access Policy

For each zone:

```text
FREE
RESERVED
READ_ONLY
READ_WRITE
EXECUTE
EXECUTE_READ
EXECUTE_READ_WRITE
GUARD
NO_ACCESS
COPY_ON_WRITE
DERIVED_SHADOW
DERIVED_MIRROR
DERIVED_OBFUSCATED
```

maintain:

```text
CanEnumerate
CanRead
CanWrite
RequiresWarning
RequiresConfirmation
RequiresSimulation
```

Example:

```text
READ_ONLY:

CanEnumerate = True
CanRead = True
CanWrite = False
RequiresWarning = True
RequiresConfirmation = True
```

---

# 69. Protected Memory Editing Principle

The editor must never interpret:

```text
PAGE_READONLY
PAGE_NOACCESS
PAGE_GUARD
```

as permission to automatically defeat the protection.

Instead:

```text
detect
display
explain
request authorized operation
revalidate
```

The UI must clearly show:

```text
CURRENT PROTECTION
REQUESTED OPERATION
ACCESS RESULT
WINDOWS ERROR
```

---

# 70. Legitimate Protection Management

Where a controlled debugging scenario legitimately requires changing page
protection, the operation must be explicit and separately authorized.

Conceptual workflow:

```text
Original Protection
        ↓
Record Original State
        ↓
Authorization Check
        ↓
Request Temporary Protection Change
        ↓
Verify Returned Protection
        ↓
Perform Authorized Operation
        ↓
Restore Original Protection
        ↓
Verify Restoration
        ↓
Audit
```

Never permanently alter protection merely to make an editor easier to use.

If restoration fails:

```text
CRITICAL WARNING
```

must be generated and the condition must be logged.

---

# 71. Guard-Page Principle

`PAGE_GUARD` is a special condition.

The engine must:

```text
detect
display
warn
avoid automatic repeated access
```

A guard-page region must not be treated as an ordinary readable region.

If a read operation fails:

```text
record failure
record address
record protection
record Windows error
continue safely
```

where continuation is possible.

---

# 72. No-Access Principle

For:

```text
PAGE_NOACCESS
```

the default behavior is:

```text
enumerate = YES
inspect metadata = YES
read = NO
write = NO
```

The UI should show:

```text
NOT ACCESSIBLE

Protection:
PAGE_NOACCESS

Reason:
Memory protection prevents requested operation.
```

Do not repeatedly attempt the same denied operation.

---

# 73. Execute-Only / Executable Memory Principle

Executable regions must be treated carefully.

Display:

```text
Executable
Readable
Writable
Copy-On-Write
Guard
```

derived from verified protection flags.

Do not automatically modify executable regions.

Editing executable memory requires:

```text
explicit selection
explicit authorization
confirmation
precondition verification
post-write verification
audit
```

---

# 74. Temporary Access Changes

If a legitimate debugging workflow requires temporary access changes, treat them
as transactions.

```text
BEGIN ACCESS TRANSACTION

Capture:
    region
    address
    size
    original protection

Authorize:
    operation
    target
    reason

Change:
    temporary protection

Verify:
    changed protection

Perform:
    requested operation

Restore:
    original protection

Verify:
    restored protection

AUDIT:
    complete transaction
```

If any stage fails:

```text
fail closed
```

Do not continue to the next destructive operation.

---

# 75. Editing Protected Regions

Protected-memory editing requires all of:

```text
[ ] target identity verified
[ ] region identity verified
[ ] address validated
[ ] region bounds validated
[ ] protection verified
[ ] requested operation authorized
[ ] original bytes captured
[ ] proposed bytes validated
[ ] user confirmation obtained
[ ] protection transition explicitly authorized if applicable
[ ] write performed
[ ] read-back performed where possible
[ ] result compared
[ ] original protection restored where applicable
[ ] audit record generated
```

Missing any mandatory condition means:

```text
WRITE = DENIED
```

---

# 76. Stale Protection Detection

Memory protections can change after enumeration.

Therefore:

```text
Enumeration
    ↓
Time passes
    ↓
Edit requested
    ↓
Re-query region
    ↓
Compare protection
```

If:

```text
OldProtection != CurrentProtection
```

then:

```text
ABORT EDIT
```

unless the user explicitly performs a new authorization/confirmation cycle.

---

# 77. Stale Address Detection

An address observed earlier may no longer refer to the same region.

Before editing:

```text
verify:
BaseAddress
RegionSize
State
Protect
Type
AllocationBase
ProcessIdentity
```

If the region changed:

```text
STALE MEMORY SELECTION
```

and require a fresh selection.

---

# 78. Access Escalation Principle

Access escalation must be explicit.

Never implement:

```text
automatic privilege escalation
automatic token manipulation
automatic security bypass
automatic kernel escalation
automatic protection circumvention
```

Instead expose:

```text
Access Required:
PROCESS_VM_READ

Current:
Denied

Reason:
Windows refused requested access.

Action:
Run authorized debugging environment / select another permitted process.
```

---

# 79. Protected-Process Handling

If Windows identifies a target as protected or otherwise inaccessible:

```text
detect
display
record
stop unsafe attempts
```

Example:

```text
Process:
ExampleProcess

Status:
Protected / Access Restricted

Inspection:
Unavailable

Write:
Unavailable
```

The application must remain functional rather than attempting to defeat the
protection boundary.

---

# 80. Defensive Reverse-Engineering Principle

Reverse engineering should proceed:

```text
OBSERVE
 ↓
DOCUMENT
 ↓
SNAPSHOT
 ↓
COMPARE
 ↓
ANALYZE
 ↓
MODEL
 ↓
SIMULATE
 ↓
TEST
```

not:

```text
OBSERVE
 ↓
BYPASS SECURITY
 ↓
MODIFY UNKNOWN STATE
```

The objective is understanding and controlled debugging.

---

# 81. Mirror Analysis

A mirrored state may be modeled without modifying a target.

Represent:

```text
MirrorCandidate

SourceAddress
CandidateAddress
RegionSize
Similarity
Hash
ProtectionA
ProtectionB
Evidence
Confidence
```

Example:

```text
Source:
0x000001A400100000

Candidate:
0x000001A500300000

Size:
0x1000

Similarity:
100%

Classification:
Possible Mirror
```

The engine must distinguish:

```text
same content
```

from:

```text
same physical backing
```

unless the latter is independently proven.

---

# 82. Pointer Redirection Analysis

The tool may analyze pointer relationships.

Represent:

```text
PointerCandidate

PointerAddress
PointerValue
TargetRegion
Offset
Module
Confidence
```

The analysis may answer:

```text
Which address contains this pointer?
What region does it reference?
What offset exists from a known base?
Did the pointer change between snapshots?
```

It must not automatically redirect arbitrary pointers in live processes.

For testing pointer redirection:

```text
USE SIMULATION MODE
```

or a dedicated deterministic test process.

---

# 83. Memory Mirror Simulation

The `MirrorEngine` must support:

```text
Create simulated mirror
Compare source/mirror
Modify simulated mirror
Compare resulting state
Generate diff
```

without requiring modification of an arbitrary live process.

Simulation object:

```text
SimulatedMemoryRegion

BaseAddress
Size
Protection
Bytes
SourceRegion
MirrorRegion
Relationship
```

---

# 84. Protected-Zone Visualization

Every tab should show:

```text
ZONE
NATIVE PROTECTION
STATE
TYPE
READ
WRITE
EXECUTE
GUARD
DERIVED FLAGS
CONFIDENCE
```

Example:

```text
READ ONLY

Native:
MEM_COMMIT / PAGE_READONLY

Read:
YES

Write:
NO

Execute:
NO

Derived:
None
```

---

# 85. Bypass Analysis Form

The existing:

```text
BypassMethodsForm.vb
```

must be treated as a **ProtectionAnalysis** interface.

Its safe responsibilities:

```text
identify protection
identify access failure
explain cause
show evidence
show permitted debugging options
simulate alternative state
compare before/after
```

It must not provide operational instructions for defeating endpoint protection,
anti-cheat, DRM, authentication, kernel security, or other security controls.

---

# 86. Defensive "Bypass" Taxonomy

The agent may classify an apparent access barrier into:

```text
Permission Barrier
Architecture Barrier
Protection Barrier
Guard Barrier
Process-Identity Barrier
Region-State Barrier
Handle Barrier
Race Condition
Invalid Address
Insufficient Access Rights
Unsupported Operation
```

For each:

```text
Detection
Evidence
Safe Resolution
```

Example:

```text
Permission Barrier

Evidence:
OpenProcess returned ACCESS_DENIED.

Safe Resolution:
Use an authorized debugging target or launch the application under an
appropriate authorized debugging context.
```

---

# 87. Memory Control Plane

Create a central conceptual control plane:

```text
MemoryControlService
```

responsible for:

```text
Process identity
Authorization
Region validation
Operation policy
Read policy
Write policy
Audit
Verification
```

Forms must not directly make arbitrary native memory modifications.

Preferred:

```text
Form
 ↓
MemoryControlService
 ↓
MemoryEditor
 ↓
NativeMethods
```

---

# 88. Read Operation Contract

Every read should produce:

```text
ReadResult

Success
Address
RequestedSize
BytesRead
Data
ErrorCode
ErrorMessage
Region
```

Possible states:

```text
SUCCESS
PARTIAL
DENIED
INVALID_ADDRESS
REGION_CHANGED
PROCESS_EXITED
FAILED
CANCELLED
```

---

# 89. Write Operation Contract

Every write should produce:

```text
WriteResult

Success
Address
RequestedSize
BytesWritten
OriginalBytes
RequestedBytes
VerifiedBytes
VerificationResult
ErrorCode
ErrorMessage
```

Possible states:

```text
SUCCESS_VERIFIED
SUCCESS_UNVERIFIED
DENIED
PRECONDITION_FAILED
WRITE_FAILED
VERIFICATION_FAILED
CANCELLED
```

Never collapse these into a Boolean alone.

---

# 90. Security Audit Events

Record security-relevant events:

```text
PROCESS_SELECTED
PROCESS_ACCESS_GRANTED
PROCESS_ACCESS_DENIED
REGION_ENUMERATED
REGION_READ
REGION_READ_FAILED
EDIT_REQUESTED
EDIT_CONFIRMED
EDIT_CANCELLED
EDIT_DENIED
PROTECTION_CHANGED
PROTECTION_RESTORE_FAILED
WRITE_COMPLETED
WRITE_VERIFIED
WRITE_VERIFICATION_FAILED
PROCESS_EXITED
STALE_REGION_DETECTED
```

Audit records must not contain unrestricted dumps of process memory.

---

# 91. Emergency Stop

Long-running operations must support:

```text
Cancel Scan
Cancel Search
Cancel Pointer Analysis
Cancel Snapshot
Cancel XOR Analysis
Cancel Edit
```

Once cancellation is requested:

```text
stop starting new operations
complete only the minimum safe cleanup
release resources
return controlled result
```

---

# 92. Protected Memory UI Rules

Visual distinction:

```text
Readable:
normal inspection

Read-only:
inspection + warning before editing

Writable:
inspection + controlled editing

Guard:
warning + restricted access

NoAccess:
metadata only

Executable:
special warning

Derived:
explicit "DERIVED" label

Heuristic:
explicit confidence indicator
```

Never disguise a heuristic classification as a Windows-native memory state.

---

# 93. Zero-Trust Memory Editing

Every edit is treated as untrusted until validated.

Pipeline:

```text
USER INPUT
    ↓
PARSE
    ↓
VALIDATE
    ↓
NORMALIZE
    ↓
BOUNDS CHECK
    ↓
TYPE CHECK
    ↓
REGION CHECK
    ↓
AUTHORIZATION CHECK
    ↓
CONFIRMATION
    ↓
FRESH REGION CHECK
    ↓
WRITE
    ↓
READ-BACK
    ↓
COMPARE
    ↓
AUDIT
```

---

# 94. Security Principle

The fundamental rule is:

```text
ACCESS MUST BE PROVEN
EDIT MUST BE AUTHORIZED
PROTECTION MUST NOT BE SILENTLY DEFEATED
EVERY WRITE MUST BE VERIFIED
EVERY FAILURE MUST BE EXPLAINED
```

The application is a:

```text
memory diagnostic and controlled debugging tool
```

not an unrestricted security-control bypass framework.

---

# 95. Completion Requirement for Protected Memory

Before declaring the protected-memory subsystem complete, verify:

```text
[ ] inaccessible regions are classified
[ ] guard regions are identified
[ ] read-only regions are protected from accidental writes
[ ] process access failures are handled
[ ] stale regions are detected
[ ] process identity is verified
[ ] editing requires confirmation
[ ] writes are bounds checked
[ ] writes are audited
[ ] read-back verification exists
[ ] protection changes are explicit
[ ] temporary changes restore correctly
[ ] restoration failures are reported
[ ] cancellation works
[ ] no unauthorized security bypass exists
[ ] simulation mode works
[ ] protected-memory tests pass
```

Only then may the protected-memory subsystem be marked:

```text
VERIFIED
```

Otherwise:

```text
NOT VERIFIED
```

---
# SKILL.md — Process, Module, Memory & Ethical Pentesting Extension

## 96. PROCESS MANAGER PRINCIPLES

The agent SHALL implement a hardened `ProcessManager` capable of safely discovering, identifying, inspecting, and managing Windows processes.

### 96.1 Process Discovery

Support:

* enumerate all visible processes
* enumerate processes by PID
* search by process name
* search by executable path
* search by session
* search by architecture
* search by owner when permitted
* detect process creation time when available
* detect process state
* detect process termination during inspection
* refresh process lists
* sort and filter processes
* maintain stable process identity using PID + creation identity where available

Process entries SHOULD expose:

```text
PID
Parent PID
Process Name
Executable Path
Architecture
Session ID
Creation Time
Thread Count
Handle Count
Working Set
Private Memory
Commit Information
Protection Status
Integrity Level
Signer / Trust Information
WOW64 Status
Main Module
Process State
Access Status
```

The UI SHALL distinguish:

```text
Accessible
Partially Accessible
Access Denied
Protected
Terminated
Unknown
```

Never infer that an inaccessible process is malicious.

---

## 97. PROTECTED PROCESS ENUMERATION

The application SHALL identify processes that cannot be inspected normally.

Examples of relevant categories include:

```text
Normal Process
Protected Process
Protected Process Light
System Process
Service
Elevated Process
Session-Isolated Process
Access-Denied Process
```

The application SHALL report the reason an operation failed whenever Windows provides an error code.

Example:

```text
Operation:
    OpenProcess

Result:
    ACCESS_DENIED

Interpretation:
    Current security context does not possess the requested access.

Action:
    Do not automatically escalate privileges.
```

The agent MUST NOT implement:

```text
token theft
credential extraction
kernel privilege escalation
anti-cheat bypass
EDR bypass
AV bypass
protected-process circumvention
security-product disabling
stealth access
```

For authorized laboratory testing, the application MAY provide a **Protection Analysis** mode that explains which protection prevented an operation.

---

# 98. PROCESS TREE MANAGEMENT

Implement process hierarchy discovery:

```text
System
 ├── Process A
 │    ├── Child A1
 │    └── Child A2
 ├── Process B
 │    └── Child B1
 └── Process C
```

Support:

* parent PID discovery
* child process enumeration
* descendant enumeration
* process tree visualization
* process lifetime tracking
* process exit detection
* process selection from tree
* memory exploration for authorized descendants

The application SHALL NOT automatically terminate child processes.

Any destructive process operation requires:

```text
Target Identity
→ Explicit User Action
→ Confirmation
→ Authorization Check
→ Operation
→ Result
→ Audit Record
```

---

# 99. PROCESS MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS

`ProcessManager` MAY provide controlled operations such as:

```text
Refresh
Inspect
Open
Close Application Handle
Request Graceful Close
Suspend Analysis Target
Resume Analysis Target
Terminate
Set Priority
Inspect Threads
Inspect Modules
Inspect Memory
Create Snapshot
Compare Snapshot
```

Destructive operations MUST require explicit confirmation.

The application SHALL never silently terminate or suspend processes.

---

# 100. THREAD MANAGEMENT

Implement thread discovery for the selected process.

Each thread SHOULD expose:

```text
Thread ID
Owner PID
Creation Time
Priority
Base Priority
State
Wait Reason
Start Address
CPU Time
Context Availability
```

The application SHOULD support diagnostic inspection of thread activity.

Thread suspension/resumption MUST be:

```text
explicit
authorized
logged
reversible
```

Do not implement hidden thread manipulation.

---

# 101. MODULE MANAGER

Implement a `ModuleManager` abstraction.

For each selected process:

```text
Process
 ├── Main EXE
 ├── DLL
 ├── DLL
 ├── DLL
 └── Other Loaded Module
```

Display:

```text
Module Name
Full Path
Base Address
Image Size
Entry Point
Architecture
Timestamp
File Version
Product Version
Signer Information
Module State
```

Support:

* enumerate loaded modules
* refresh modules
* inspect module metadata
* locate module by name
* locate module by base address
* inspect module address range
* map module to memory regions
* compare module metadata between snapshots

---

# 102. MODULE MEMORY EXPLORATION

Every loaded module SHALL be correlatable with its process memory.

Example:

```text
kernel32.dll
Base:
0x00007FF...

Size:
0x001A0000

Regions:
    IMAGE / READ
    IMAGE / EXECUTE_READ
    IMAGE / READ_WRITE
```

The application SHOULD allow:

```text
Module
→ Sections
→ Memory Regions
→ Bytes
→ Typed Values
→ References
→ Pointers
→ Offsets
```

The module explorer SHALL distinguish:

```text
PE metadata
Mapped image
Private memory
Heap memory
Stack memory
Mapped files
Unknown regions
```

---

# 103. DLL MANAGEMENT

The project MAY support controlled DLL management for **applications owned or explicitly authorized by the operator**.

Supported conceptual operations:

```text
Inspect DLL
Verify DLL
Locate DLL
Compare DLL
Request unload
Observe unload
Verify module disappearance
```

For application-controlled plugins, normal Windows loading/unloading mechanisms MAY be supported.

The agent SHALL NOT implement covert DLL injection or stealth module loading into arbitrary third-party processes.

For testing DLL-loading behavior, use:

```text
Dedicated Test Host
+
Signed/Controlled Test DLL
+
Explicit Authorization
+
Audit Log
```

---

# 104. DLL LOAD/UNLOAD SAFETY

Before loading a test module:

```text
Validate Path
→ Verify File Exists
→ Verify Architecture
→ Verify Signature/Trust When Required
→ Verify Hash
→ Confirm Target
→ Confirm Operation
→ Load
→ Verify Module
→ Audit
```

Before unloading:

```text
Identify Module
→ Verify Target Process
→ Verify Module Identity
→ Confirm
→ Request Unload
→ Verify Result
→ Audit
```

Never unload an arbitrary system module merely because it appears in the module list.

---

# 105. GENERAL PROCESS MEMORY EXPLORER

The application SHALL provide a complete process-memory topology view.

Example:

```text
Process
│
├── Image
│
├── DLL Modules
│
├── Private Memory
│
├── Heap Regions
│
├── Stack Regions
│
├── Mapped Files
│
├── Shared Memory
│
├── Guard Pages
│
├── Reserved Regions
│
└── Free Address Space
```

The explorer SHALL obtain region metadata using supported Windows memory-management APIs.

Each region SHALL contain:

```text
BaseAddress
AllocationBase
RegionSize
State
Protect
AllocationProtect
Type
Native Classification
Derived Classification
Confidence
```

---

# 106. SUBPROCESS MEMORY EXPLORATION

For an authorized process tree:

```text
Root Process
 ├── Child Process A
 │    ├── Memory
 │    └── Modules
 │
 └── Child Process B
      ├── Memory
      └── Modules
```

The application SHALL allow switching between process contexts.

Every memory view MUST clearly identify:

```text
Target PID
Process Name
Process Creation Identity
Architecture
```

This prevents accidentally editing the wrong process.

---

# 107. MODULE MEMORY EXPLORER

The module explorer SHALL allow:

```text
Select Module
→ Identify Base
→ Determine Size
→ Enumerate Corresponding Regions
→ Read Authorized Memory
→ Decode Bytes
→ Display Types
→ Search
→ Analyze References
```

The explorer SHOULD support:

```text
HEX
ASCII
UNICODE
INT8
UINT8
INT16
UINT16
INT32
UINT32
INT64
UINT64
FLOAT
DOUBLE
POINTER
```

---

# 108. MEMORY ZONE CORRELATION

The application SHALL correlate process modules with memory regions.

Example:

```text
Module:
test.dll

Mapped Range:
0x10000000 - 0x101AFFFF

Memory Regions:
0x10000000 - 0x10004FFF  RX
0x10005000 - 0x1017FFFF  R
0x10180000 - 0x101AFFFF  RW
```

This allows the operator to understand the actual virtual-memory layout instead of assuming that an entire DLL has one protection state.

---

# 109. MEMORY ZONE PROTECTION ANALYSIS

Analyze:

```text
PAGE_NOACCESS
PAGE_READONLY
PAGE_READWRITE
PAGE_WRITECOPY
PAGE_EXECUTE
PAGE_EXECUTE_READ
PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE
PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY
PAGE_GUARD
PAGE_NOCACHE
PAGE_WRITECOMBINE
```

Derived classifications MAY include:

```text
Shadow
Mirror
Obfuscated
Confidential
Suspicious
Unknown
```

These derived classifications MUST NEVER be presented as native Windows memory types.

---

# 110. GUARDED-PAGE ANALYSIS

For `PAGE_GUARD` regions:

```text
Detect
→ Record
→ Display
→ Explain
→ Warn
```

The application SHALL NOT repeatedly probe guarded pages simply to defeat the guard mechanism.

For an authorized test process, the application MAY provide a **Guard-Page Lab Simulator** that demonstrates:

```text
Guard Page
→ Access Attempt
→ Guard Event
→ Protection Transition
→ Recovery
```

without attacking an unrelated process.

---

# 111. PROTECTED-ZONE ACCESS MODEL

Every memory operation SHALL pass:

```text
TARGET
↓
PROCESS IDENTITY
↓
REGION DISCOVERY
↓
REGION STATE
↓
PROTECTION
↓
REQUESTED OPERATION
↓
AUTHORIZATION
↓
CONFIRMATION
↓
EXECUTION
↓
VERIFICATION
↓
AUDIT
```

No implicit bypass.

---

# 112. ETHICAL PENTESTING MODE

The application SHALL include an explicit:

```text
ETHICAL PENTEST / LAB MODE
```

with authorization boundaries.

Allowed targets:

```text
Own Application
Own Test Process
Dedicated VM
CTF Environment
Authorized Laboratory
Authorized Security Assessment
```

The mode SHALL record:

```text
Target
Scope
Operator
Start Time
End Time
Operations
Findings
Evidence
Result
```

---

# 113. PENTESTING TECHNIQUE CATEGORIES

The agent MAY implement defensive detection and laboratory demonstrations for:

```text
Memory Permission Anomalies
Executable Writable Memory
Unexpected Module Mapping
Untrusted DLL Loading
DLL Search-Order Risks
Module Replacement Detection
Code Integrity Mismatch
Unexpected Memory Mapping
Pointer Corruption
Invalid Pointer Chains
Stale Pointers
Suspicious RWX Regions
Guard-Page Behavior
Heap Corruption Indicators
Stack Anomalies
Memory Tampering
Unexpected Byte Changes
Configuration/Memory Drift
```

The implementation SHALL emphasize:

```text
detect
measure
record
simulate
verify
restore
```

rather than covert exploitation.

---

# 114. MEMORY EXPLOIT RESEARCH MODE

The term `Exploit` SHALL mean a controlled security-test scenario.

Implement a safe abstraction:

```text
ExploitResearchScenario
```

containing:

```text
ScenarioId
Target
InitialState
TriggerCondition
ObservedBehavior
SecurityBoundary
ExpectedResult
ActualResult
Evidence
Cleanup
```

Example:

```text
RWX Memory Test
```

can determine:

```text
Does the test application contain writable + executable memory?
```

without automatically turning the tool into a remote-code-execution framework.

---

# 115. XOR / OBFUSCATION ANALYSIS

`XorEngine` SHALL support defensive analysis.

Supported operations:

```text
XOR single-byte key analysis
XOR repeated-key analysis
Known-plaintext comparison
Entropy measurement
Byte-frequency analysis
ASCII candidate detection
UTF-8 candidate detection
UTF-16 candidate detection
Hex transformation
Before/after comparison
```

Example:

```text
Original:
4A 19 7F 20

Key:
55

Derived:
1F 4C 2A 75
```

The tool SHALL clearly distinguish:

```text
Observed Bytes
Candidate Transformation
Decoded Candidate
Confidence
```

It MUST NOT claim that an arbitrary XOR result is the original plaintext without evidence.

---

# 116. OBFUSCATION DETECTION

Possible indicators:

```text
High byte entropy
Repeated XOR relationships
Known constant masks
Suspicious byte distributions
Encoded strings
Compressed regions
Unusual alignment
Repeated transformation patterns
```

The result SHALL be:

```text
Potential Obfuscation
Confidence: 0.XX
Evidence: [...]
```

rather than:

```text
OBFUSCATED = TRUE
```

unless a deterministic transformation is established.

---

# 117. POINTER EXPLORER

Implement:

```text
PointerScanner
```

for authorized memory analysis.

The scanner MAY identify candidate pointers by:

```text
Pointer-width interpretation
Address-range validation
Alignment
Mapped-region membership
Module-range membership
Stack-range membership
Heap-range membership
Snapshot comparison
```

Display:

```text
Pointer Address
Pointer Value
Target Region
Target Module
Offset
Depth
Confidence
```

---

# 118. OFFSET EXPLORER

Calculate:

```text
TargetAddress - BaseAddress
```

and display:

```text
Base:
0x00007FF000000000

Target:
0x00007FF000001250

Offset:
0x1250
```

Support:

```text
Module + Offset
Region + Offset
AllocationBase + Offset
Pointer + Offset
Snapshot-relative Offset
```

Checked arithmetic SHALL be mandatory.

---

# 119. POINTER-CHAIN ANALYSIS

For authorized test memory:

```text
Base
 ↓
Pointer + Offset
 ↓
Pointer + Offset
 ↓
Final Address
```

Example representation:

```text
module.dll
+0x120
→ +0x30
→ +0x18
→ Target
```

The tool SHALL distinguish:

```text
Observed Pointer
Candidate Pointer
Validated Pointer
Stale Pointer
Invalid Pointer
```

---

# 120. MIRRORED MEMORY MODEL

Implement `MirrorEngine` as a controlled memory-analysis subsystem.

A mirror is a representation of observed memory, not automatically a hidden duplicate of another process.

Supported modes:

```text
Snapshot Mirror
Read-Only Mirror
Differential Mirror
Module Mirror
Region Mirror
Simulated Mirror
```

Example:

```text
Live Region
    ↓
Read
    ↓
Mirror Buffer
    ↓
Analyze
    ↓
Modify Simulation
    ↓
Compare
```

---

# 121. MIRROR CREATION

A mirror SHALL contain:

```text
Target Identity
Base Address
Region Size
Protection
State
Timestamp
Hash
Raw Bytes
Metadata
```

For large regions, use bounded chunks.

Never allocate unbounded memory based on attacker-controlled region sizes.

---

# 122. MIRROR DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS

Compare:

```text
Mirror A
vs
Mirror B
```

and report:

```text
Changed Address
Old Bytes
New Bytes
Changed Length
Region
Module
Timestamp
Hash
```

This enables detection of:

```text
unexpected memory modification
configuration changes
module changes
runtime state changes
```

---

# 123. SIMULATED MEMORY REDIRECTION

Pointer/memory redirection MAY be modeled without changing an arbitrary live process.

Example:

```text
Original:
Pointer A → Region X

Simulation:
Pointer A → Mirror X
```

The UI SHALL label this:

```text
SIMULATION ONLY
```

A live-process redirection operation requires a separate explicit authorized debugging workflow and SHALL NOT be silently performed.

---

# 124. MEMORY EDIT TRANSACTION

All live edits SHALL use:

```text
Capture
↓
Validate
↓
Authorize
↓
Confirm
↓
Revalidate
↓
Write
↓
Read Back
↓
Compare
↓
Record
```

The transaction SHALL fail closed if:

```text
PID changed
process exited
region changed
protection changed
address changed
expected bytes changed
requested length changed
authorization expired
```

---

# 125. PROCESS/MEMORY SNAPSHOT

Create a unified snapshot:

```text
Process
├── Identity
├── Modules
├── Threads
├── Memory Regions
├── Selected Bytes
├── Protection States
└── Hashes
```

Snapshots SHALL support:

```text
Save
Load
Compare
Diff
Export
Hash
Verify
```

---

# 126. HARDENED PROCESS MANAGER SERVICES

Recommended services:

```text
ProcessManager
ProcessAccessService
ProcessIdentityService
ProcessTreeService
ThreadManager
ModuleManager
ModuleVerificationService
MemoryInspector
MemoryEditor
MemoryRegionService
MemorySnapshotService
MemoryDiffService
PointerScanner
OffsetAnalyzer
XorEngine
ObfuscationAnalyzer
MirrorEngine
ProtectionAnalyzer
AuditLogService
AuthorizationService
ValidationService
```

---

# 127. PROCESS IDENTITY PROTECTION

Never trust PID alone.

Use:

```text
PID
+
Process Creation Identity
+
Executable Path
+
Main Module
+
Architecture
```

before destructive or write operations.

This protects against PID reuse.

---

# 128. HANDLE MANAGEMENT

Every native handle SHALL:

```text
be checked after acquisition
have the minimum required access
be released deterministically
never be leaked
never be reused after disposal
```

Prefer:

```text
SafeHandle
```

over raw unmanaged handles wherever practical.

---

# 129. ACCESS-RIGHT MINIMIZATION

Use separate access profiles:

```text
ProcessQueryOnly
ProcessMemoryRead
ProcessMemoryWrite
ProcessDebug
ProcessControl
ModuleInspection
```

Do not request maximum process access for every operation.

Example:

```text
Memory View
→ query + read

Memory Edit
→ query + read + explicitly authorized write

Process Termination
→ explicit control access
```

---

# 130. FAIL-CLOSED PRINCIPLE

If an operation cannot establish:

```text
Who is the target?
What region is targeted?
What operation is requested?
Why is it authorized?
What bytes are expected?
What protection exists?
```

then:

```text
DO NOT MODIFY MEMORY
```

The application MAY still provide read-only diagnostics.

---

# 131. SECURITY EVENT LOGGING

Audit events SHOULD include:

```text
Timestamp
PID
Process Identity
Module
Address
Region
Operation
Requested Length
Protection
Result
Error Code
Previous Hash
New Hash
Operator Confirmation
```

Never log secrets or unnecessarily dump sensitive memory contents.

---

# 132. UI PROCESS EXPLORER

Main UI SHOULD provide:

```text
Processes
├── Normal
├── Protected
├── Services
├── System
└── Access Denied
```

Selecting a process opens:

```text
[Overview]
[Threads]
[Modules]
[Memory]
[Memory Map]
[Snapshots]
[Pointer Explorer]
[Offset Explorer]
[Protection]
[Audit]
```

Selecting a module opens:

```text
[Module Info]
[Sections]
[Mapped Memory]
[Hex]
[Strings]
[References]
[Diff]
```

---

# 133. MEMORY EXPLORATION TABS

The existing 12 memory tabs SHALL remain available:

```text
1  Free
2  Read Only
3  Read Write
4  Page Guard
5  Shadow Zone
6  Obfuscated Zone
7  Mirrored Zone
8  Execute
9  Execute Read
10 Execute Read Write
11 Confidential
12 Not Accessible
```

Additional filters:

```text
Process
Module
Region
Protection
State
Address
Size
Type
Confidence
```

---

# 134. ETHICAL SECURITY BOUNDARY

The agent SHALL understand:

```text
AUTHORIZED SECURITY TESTING
≠
UNAUTHORIZED SECURITY BYPASS
```

Allowed:

```text
inspect
classify
measure
snapshot
compare
simulate
validate
test owned software
test laboratory processes
test controlled DLLs
analyze protection behavior
detect vulnerabilities
document findings
restore test state
```

Disallowed implementation goals:

```text
stealth injection
credential theft
security-product evasion
anti-cheat bypass
EDR bypass
AV bypass
protected-process circumvention
kernel exploit deployment
persistence
covert process manipulation
unauthorized DLL injection
```

---

# 135. DEFENSIVE PENTEST RESULT MODEL

Every finding SHALL have:

```text
Finding ID
Severity
Target
Evidence
Reproduction Context
Security Boundary
Observed Behavior
Expected Behavior
Risk
Recommended Mitigation
Verification
```

Example:

```text
FINDING: MEM-001

Severity:
High

Finding:
Executable + writable private memory detected.

Evidence:
Region 0x....

Protection:
PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE

Recommendation:
Separate executable and writable memory where possible.
```

---

# 136. AGENT DEVELOPMENT RULE

When implementing these features, the coding agent SHALL proceed:

```text
Understand
→ Inspect Existing Architecture
→ Define Contract
→ Implement One File
→ Compile
→ Analyze Diagnostics
→ Test
→ Fix
→ Record Evidence
→ Request Next File
```

Do not invent APIs or project files that do not exist.

---

# 137. ONE-FILE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT

When the user requests:

```text
next file
```

the agent SHALL output exactly:

```text
ONE COMPLETE FILE
```

and SHALL NOT silently generate multiple project files.

The generated file MUST:

```text
compile within the intended architecture
follow Option Strict On
use explicit types
validate external input
avoid unmanaged-resource leaks
respect cancellation
respect authorization boundaries
avoid unnecessary privileges
document security-sensitive operations
```

---

# 138. FINAL SYSTEM OBJECTIVE

The completed application is a:

> Hardened Windows Process, Module, Memory Inspection, Controlled Editing, Protection Analysis, Snapshot, Pointer/Offset Exploration, XOR/Obfuscation Analysis, and Ethical Security Testing Platform.

Its fundamental pipeline is:

```text
PROCESS DISCOVERY
        ↓
PROCESS IDENTITY
        ↓
ACCESS CLASSIFICATION
        ↓
MODULE ENUMERATION
        ↓
MEMORY MAP
        ↓
REGION CLASSIFICATION
        ↓
MEMORY INSPECTION
        ↓
TYPE / HEX / STRING ANALYSIS
        ↓
POINTER / OFFSET ANALYSIS
        ↓
XOR / OBFUSCATION ANALYSIS
        ↓
SNAPSHOT / MIRROR
        ↓
DIFF / VERIFICATION
        ↓
AUTHORIZED EDIT
        ↓
READ-BACK
        ↓
AUDIT
        ↓
RESTORE / VERIFY
```

The governing security principle is:

```text
OBSERVE → VERIFY → AUTHORIZE → ACT → VERIFY AGAIN → AUDIT
```

Never:

```text
DISCOVER → BYPASS → MODIFY
```

unless the operation is confined to a controlled security laboratory/simulation where the security boundary being tested belongs to the authorized test environment.

# ADVANCED PROCESS & MEMORY SECURITY RESEARCH LAYER

## 139. DUAL-PERSPECTIVE SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

Every security technique SHALL have two linked representations:

```text
ATTACK / FAILURE MODE
        ↓
OBSERVABLE EFFECTS
        ↓
DETECTION
        ↓
PREVENTION
        ↓
CONTAINMENT
        ↓
RECOVERY
        ↓
VERIFICATION
```

The agent SHALL never design an offensive technique without simultaneously designing its defensive control.

Every technique receives:

```text
Technique ID
Attack Class
Required Preconditions
Target Surface
Observable Indicators
Detection Method
Prevention Method
Mitigation
Recovery
Test Procedure
Evidence Requirements
```

---

# 140. SECURITY RESEARCH DOMAINS

The security subsystem SHALL cover:

```text
PROCESS
THREAD
HANDLE
TOKEN / ACCESS CONTEXT
MODULE
DLL
PE IMAGE
VIRTUAL MEMORY
HEAP
STACK
IMAGE SECTIONS
PRIVATE MEMORY
MAPPED MEMORY
SHARED MEMORY
GUARD PAGES

STRINGS
ENCODED DATA
XOR
OBFUSCATION
MEMORY CORRUPTION
MEMORY TAMPERING
PROCESS ANOMALIES
MODULE ANOMALIES
CODE-INTEGRITY ANOMALIES
```

---

# 141. ATTACK-SURFACE MATRIX

Create a machine-readable security matrix:

```text
Surface
Technique
Precondition
Observable Signal
Severity
Detection
Prevention
Response
Recovery
```

Example:

```text
MEM-PERM-001
Surface:
Virtual Memory

Condition:
Unexpected writable + executable region

Detection:
Memory-protection scan

Defense:
W^X policy where practical

Response:
Alert + capture evidence

Recovery:
Terminate/isolate controlled test target if policy requires
```

---

# 142. PROCESS ATTACK/ANOMALY TAXONOMY

Analyze:

```text
Unexpected Process Creation
Unexpected Parent/Child Relationship
Unexpected Process Termination
Unexpected Suspension
Unexpected Priority Change
Unexpected Architecture
Unexpected Session
Unexpected Executable Path
Unexpected Integrity Level
Unexpected Access Pattern
Unexpected Handle Activity
Unexpected Module Set
Unexpected Memory Map
Unexpected Resource Consumption
Unexpected Process Identity Change
```

Detection SHOULD compare:

```text
CURRENT PROCESS STATE
        vs
TRUSTED BASELINE
```

---

# 143. PROCESS BASELINE ENGINE

Implement:

```text
ProcessBaseline
```

containing:

```text
Executable Hash
Executable Path
Architecture
Parent Identity
Expected Modules
Expected Module Hashes
Expected Memory Regions
Expected Protection
Expected Threads
Expected Services
Expected Resource Range
Expected Signer
```

Then calculate:

```text
Process Drift Score
```

based on observed deviations.

---

# 144. PROCESS ANOMALY ENGINE

Implement:

```text
ProcessAnomalyDetector
```

with detectors:

```text
ExecutablePathMismatch
ParentMismatch
ModuleMismatch
UnexpectedModule
UnsignedModule
ModuleHashMismatch
MemoryProtectionAnomaly
ExecutableWritableMemory
UnexpectedPrivateExecutableMemory
UnexpectedMappedImage
RegionCountDrift
PointerDrift
ThreadDrift
HandleDrift
ResourceDrift
ProcessIdentityMismatch
```

Each detector produces:

```text
Finding
Confidence
Evidence
Severity
Recommended Action
```

---

# 145. MEMORY ATTACK-SURFACE MATRIX

Analyze every region according to:

```text
State
Protection
Type
Origin
Ownership
Module Association
Readability
Writability
Executability
Guard Status
Backing Object
Entropy
Content Classification
Temporal Behavior
```

A region SHOULD receive a security score:

```text
MemoryRiskScore ∈ [0,100]
```

The score SHALL be explainable.

Never produce unexplained risk numbers.

---

# 146. MEMORY PROTECTION ANOMALIES

Detect:

```text
RWX regions
Unexpected executable private memory
Unexpected writable image regions
Protection transitions
Executable heap regions
Executable stack regions
Unexpected PAGE_GUARD
Unexpected PAGE_NOACCESS
Unexpected protection changes
Image-section protection mismatch
Copy-on-write anomalies
```

Protection history SHOULD be recorded as:

```text
Timestamp
Old Protection
New Protection
Region
Process
Trigger / Source when observable
```

---

# 147. MEMORY CORRUPTION RESEARCH

The laboratory subsystem MAY model:

```text
Out-of-Bounds Write
Out-of-Bounds Read
Use-After-Free
Double-Free
Invalid Pointer
Stale Pointer
Type Confusion
Integer Overflow
Integer Underflow
Truncated Pointer
Misaligned Access
Stack Corruption
Heap Corruption
VTable Corruption
Function-Pointer Corruption
Metadata Corruption
```

The production application SHALL prioritize detection and controlled reproduction rather than weaponization.

---

# 148. MEMORY CORRUPTION DETECTION

Use multiple independent signals:

```text
Guard Regions
Canary Values
Page Protection
Allocation Metadata
Known Object Boundaries
Pointer Validation
Region Membership
Snapshot Hashes
Differential Analysis
Heap Diagnostics
Stack Consistency
Module Integrity
Code Integrity
```

A finding becomes high-confidence when multiple independent detectors agree.

---

# 149. CANARY MEMORY MODEL

For controlled test applications:

```text
[CANARY]
[OBJECT]
[CANARY]
```

Monitor:

```text
CanaryBefore
CanaryAfter
ModificationTime
Writer Context
Affected Address
```

Any unexpected modification produces:

```text
MEMORY-CORRUPTION-DETECTED
```

---

# 150. SHADOW MEMORY

Implement a defensive shadow representation:

```text
Live Memory
     ↓
Shadow Metadata
```

The shadow layer stores:

```text
Address
Length
Expected Protection
Expected Hash
Expected Type
Expected Ownership
Expected State
```

It does not need to duplicate every byte.

This enables efficient tamper detection.

---

# 151. SHADOW-BYTE MODEL

For higher-assurance laboratory targets:

```text
Live Byte
Shadow Byte
Expected Byte
```

Comparison:

```text
Live == Expected
```

produces:

```text
UNCHANGED
```

while:

```text
Live != Expected
```

produces:

```text
MODIFIED
```

The system SHALL distinguish legitimate application changes from unauthorized changes using policy and temporal context.

---

# 152. MIRROR ARCHITECTURE

Implement multiple mirror modes.

### Mode A — Snapshot Mirror

```text
Live
 ↓
Snapshot
 ↓
Offline Analysis
```

Use for forensic analysis.

### Mode B — Differential Mirror

```text
Snapshot A
     ↓
Application Activity
     ↓
Snapshot B
     ↓
Diff
```

Use for identifying modifications.

### Mode C — Region Mirror

Mirror only one region.

```text
Region
 ↓
Mirror Buffer
```

Use for large processes.

### Mode D — Module Mirror

Mirror:

```text
EXE/DLL
 ↓
Sections
 ↓
Memory
```

Use for module integrity.

### Mode E — Protection Mirror

Mirror only metadata:

```text
Address
Size
Protection
State
Type
```

Use for fast anomaly detection.

### Mode F — Typed Mirror

Store decoded representations:

```text
Byte
Integer
Float
Double
Pointer
String
```

Use for structured analysis.

### Mode G — Simulation Mirror

Modify the mirror without modifying the live target:

```text
LIVE
 ↓
MIRROR
 ↓
SIMULATED MODIFICATION
 ↓
EXPECTED EFFECT
```

This SHALL be the preferred mechanism for experimenting with dangerous modifications.

---

# 153. MIRROR BRANCHING

Allow:

```text
Mirror A
 ├── Branch A1
 ├── Branch A2
 └── Branch A3
```

Each branch can represent a hypothetical state.

Example:

```text
Original
 ├── Pointer Modified
 ├── Protection Modified
 └── Data Modified
```

No branch modification automatically affects live memory.

---

# 154. MIRROR REPLAY

A mirror MAY contain an event sequence:

```text
T0 Initial
T1 Modification
T2 Protection Change
T3 Module Load
T4 Memory Change
T5 Restoration
```

The analyzer can replay the state transition offline.

This enables investigation without repeatedly touching the live process.

---

# 155. MIRROR TRANSACTION

For controlled debugging:

```text
Capture
→ Clone
→ Modify Clone
→ Validate
→ Compare
→ Generate Proposed Patch
→ Explicit Confirmation
→ Revalidate Live State
→ Apply Authorized Change
→ Read Back
→ Verify
```

The system SHALL never assume the live process still matches the mirror.

---

# 156. MEMORY EDITOR — COMPLETE REPRESENTATION MODEL

The editor SHALL support editing through representations rather than treating every value as a raw integer.

Representations:

```text
Raw Bytes
Hex
Binary
ASCII
UTF-8
UTF-16
Int8
UInt8
Int16
UInt16
Int32
UInt32
Int64
UInt64
Float
Double
Pointer
Address
Offset
```

Each edit MUST preserve the exact byte representation.

---

# 157. TYPE-SAFE MEMORY EDITING

Before editing:

```text
Address Valid
+
Length Valid
+
Region Valid
+
Protection Valid
+
Type Valid
+
Alignment Valid
+
Expected Bytes Match
```

Then:

```text
Confirm
→ Write
→ Read Back
→ Decode
→ Compare
```

---

# 158. PARTIAL BYTE EDITING

Support precise modifications:

```text
Single Bit
Nibble
Byte
Byte Range
Integer
Floating Point
String
Pointer
```

Bit editing:

```text
Original:
10110110

Mask:
00000100

Modified:
10110010
```

The editor MUST display:

```text
Original
Mask
Result
```

before confirmation.

---

# 159. BYTE-RANGE EDITOR

Allow:

```text
Start Address
End Address
Length
Original Bytes
Replacement Bytes
```

Constraints:

```text
Replacement Length == Expected Length
```

unless an explicit structural operation is being performed in a controlled test target.

---

# 160. STRUCTURED EDITOR

For recognized structures:

```text
Address
 ↓
Field
 ├── Offset
 ├── Type
 ├── Size
 ├── Current Value
 └── Proposed Value
```

Example:

```text
Object
+0x00 Int32
+0x04 Float
+0x08 Pointer
+0x10 Flags
```

This allows highly specific editing without guessing byte layouts.

---

# 161. POINTER EDIT SAFETY

Pointer editing SHALL require:

```text
Pointer Width Verification
Target Address Validation
Target Region Validation
Target Lifetime Validation
Alignment Verification
```

The UI SHALL show:

```text
OLD POINTER
TARGET REGION
TARGET MODULE
OFFSET
NEW POINTER
NEW TARGET REGION
```

before modification.

---

# 162. OFFSET PATCH MODEL

Represent an edit as:

```text
Module
+
Offset
+
Expected Bytes
+
Replacement Bytes
```

Example:

```text
test.dll
+0x1250

Expected:
AA BB CC

Replacement:
AA 00 CC
```

The expected-byte check prevents applying a patch to the wrong version.

---

# 163. MODULE INTEGRITY DETECTION

For each DLL/EXE:

```text
File Hash
Mapped Memory Hash
Section Hashes
Export Information
Import Information
Base Address
Image Size
Protection
```

Compare:

```text
Disk Image
vs
Mapped Image
```

and report discrepancies for investigation.

The analyzer MUST account for legitimate loader/runtime differences before declaring tampering.

---

# 164. DLL ANOMALY DETECTION

Detect:

```text
Unexpected DLL
Unexpected Path
Duplicate Module Identity
Unsigned Module
Signature Mismatch
Hash Mismatch
Architecture Mismatch
Unexpected Load Time
Unexpected Module Base
Suspicious Memory Protection
Image/Memory Inconsistency
```

---

# 165. DLL SECURITY TEST MATRIX

Controlled laboratory tests SHOULD cover:

```text
Unexpected DLL Loading
DLL Search-Path Risk
Unsigned Plugin
Modified Plugin
Wrong Architecture
Duplicate Dependency
Unexpected Module Replacement
Module Integrity Drift
Executable/Writable Module Region
Abnormal Module Lifetime
```

For every test:

```text
ATTACK SIMULATION
+
DETECTION
+
PREVENTION
+
RESPONSE
+
RECOVERY
```

---

# 166. OBFUSCATION DEFENSE LAYER

The security subsystem SHALL detect:

```text
XOR
Rolling XOR
Repeated-Key XOR
Bit Rotation
Byte Swapping
Nibble Swapping
Simple Substitution
Encoded Strings
Compressed Payload Indicators
High-Entropy Blocks
Encrypted-Looking Blocks
Runtime Decode Regions
```

Detection is analytical.

Do not assume high entropy means encryption.

---

# 167. MEMORY ENTROPY MAP

Divide memory into bounded blocks:

```text
Region
 ↓
Block 0
Block 1
Block 2
...
Block N
```

Calculate:

```text
Shannon Entropy
Byte Frequency
Printable Ratio
Zero Ratio
Repeated Pattern Ratio
```

Display:

```text
Address
Size
Entropy
Classification
Confidence
```

---

# 168. TEMPORAL MEMORY ANALYSIS

Repeatedly observe selected regions:

```text
T0
T1
T2
T3
...
```

Calculate:

```text
Change Frequency
Changed Bytes
Protection Changes
Module Association
Write Frequency
```

This allows detection of:

```text
rapidly changing regions
unexpected persistent modifications
runtime unpacking/decryption
configuration changes
tampering
```

---

# 169. MEMORY ANOMALY FUSION ENGINE

Create:

```text
MemoryAnomalyFusionEngine
```

Inputs:

```text
Protection
Hash
Entropy
Temporal Changes
Module Association
Pointer Validity
Executable Status
Write Activity
Region Type
Process Baseline
```

Output:

```text
Risk Score
Confidence
Evidence Set
```

Example:

```text
Risk:
82/100

Evidence:
- Private executable memory
- Protection transition
- High entropy
- Newly created region
- Not associated with known module
```

The system SHALL expose the evidence rather than hiding the scoring logic.

---

# 170. PROCESS + MEMORY CORRELATION

Correlate:

```text
Process Event
      ↓
Thread Event
      ↓
Module Event
      ↓
Memory Event
      ↓
Protection Event
```

Example:

```text
New Module
    ↓
New Executable Region
    ↓
Protection Change
    ↓
Memory Content Change
```

This is stronger evidence than analyzing any single event independently.

---

# 171. SECURITY EVENT GRAPH

Build an event graph:

```text
PROCESS
  │
  ├── MODULE LOAD
  │      │
  │      └── MEMORY REGION
  │
  ├── THREAD
  │
  └── PROTECTION CHANGE
          │
          └── MEMORY CHANGE
```

This graph SHALL support investigation and timeline reconstruction.

---

# 172. DEFENSIVE RESPONSE LEVELS

Use:

```text
LEVEL 0
Informational

LEVEL 1
Observation

LEVEL 2
Warning

LEVEL 3
High Confidence Anomaly

LEVEL 4
Critical Integrity Violation
```

Actions MAY include:

```text
Log
Snapshot
Freeze Analysis
Capture Evidence
Notify
Isolate Controlled Target
Terminate Controlled Test Process
Restore Known-Good Test State
```

Production systems SHOULD default to non-destructive responses.

---

# 173. SECURITY HARDENING ENGINE

Implement:

```text
MemoryHardeningAnalyzer
```

Recommendations MAY include:

```text
Reduce executable writable memory
Apply W^X where feasible
Use DEP-compatible configuration
Use ASLR-compatible builds
Enable Control Flow Guard where appropriate
Use code signing
Validate DLLs
Minimize privileges
Restrict module search paths
Validate plugin integrity
Use secure allocation patterns
Use guard/canary mechanisms
Use memory-safe languages where practical
Enable compiler hardening
```

The analyzer SHALL distinguish:

```text
Detected
Recommended
Verified
Not Applicable
Unknown
```

---

# 174. PROCESS HARDENING ENGINE

Implement:

```text
ProcessHardeningAnalyzer
```

Evaluate:

```text
Privilege Level
Integrity Level
Executable Trust
Module Trust
Memory Protections
Process Mitigation Policies
Unexpected Handles
Unexpected Children
Unexpected Modules
Unexpected Memory
```

Output:

```text
Security Posture
+
Weaknesses
+
Evidence
+
Remediation
```

---

# 175. ATTACK SIMULATOR

Create a controlled:

```text
SecurityLabSimulator
```

with simulated scenarios:

```text
SIM-MEM-001
Protection Change

SIM-MEM-002
Unexpected Byte Modification

SIM-MEM-003
Pointer Corruption

SIM-MEM-004
Invalid Offset

SIM-MEM-005
Guard Page Access

SIM-MEM-006
Executable Writable Region

SIM-MOD-001
Unexpected DLL

SIM-MOD-002
Module Hash Drift

SIM-PROC-001
Unexpected Child Process

SIM-PROC-002
Process Identity Drift
```

The simulator generates synthetic evidence for the defensive engine.

---

# 176. DEFENSE COVERAGE MATRIX

The project SHALL maintain:

```text
Technique
Detection
Prevention
Containment
Recovery
Test
Evidence
Status
```

Example:

```text
Technique:
Memory Tampering

Detection:
Snapshot + hash + temporal monitor

Prevention:
Least privilege + integrity controls

Containment:
Stop accepting edits

Recovery:
Restore known-good state

Verification:
Re-hash

Status:
VERIFIED
```

---

# 177. ZERO-TRUST MEMORY OPERATION

Every operation SHALL follow:

```text
NEVER TRUST ADDRESS
NEVER TRUST PID
NEVER TRUST MODULE
NEVER TRUST POINTER
NEVER TRUST MIRROR
NEVER TRUST TYPE
NEVER TRUST PREVIOUS PROTECTION
NEVER TRUST PREVIOUS PROCESS STATE
```

Everything MUST be revalidated immediately before modification.

---

# 178. SECURITY-IN-DEPTH

The application SHALL use multiple independent controls:

```text
Identity Verification
+
Authorization
+
Bounds Checking
+
Protection Checking
+
Expected-Byte Validation
+
Type Validation
+
Transaction
+
Read-Back
+
Hash Verification
+
Audit Logging
```

Failure of any critical control SHALL stop the operation.

---

# 179. FORENSIC EVIDENCE PRESERVATION

Before high-risk analysis:

```text
Capture Process Identity
Capture Module List
Capture Memory Map
Capture Relevant Bytes
Capture Protection
Capture Hashes
Capture Timestamp
```

Evidence SHOULD be immutable after capture.

---

# 180. ANTI-TAMPERING DETECTION

Detect:

```text
Unexpected Byte Change
Unexpected Region Creation
Unexpected Region Removal
Protection Change
Module Change
Module Hash Change
Pointer Change
Executable Memory Creation
Unexpected Process Child
Unexpected Thread
Unexpected Process State
```

The detector SHOULD compare both:

```text
STATE
+
EVENT HISTORY
```

---

# 181. FALSE-POSITIVE CONTROL

No individual indicator SHALL automatically equal compromise.

For example:

```text
RWX Region
```

is an indicator, not proof.

Require contextual correlation:

```text
Protection
+
Region Type
+
Module
+
Temporal Behavior
+
Content
+
Baseline
```

---

# 182. SECURITY CONFIDENCE MODEL

Use:

```text
Observed
Correlated
Validated
Confirmed
```

Never collapse these states.

Example:

```text
Observed:
Unexpected executable region

Correlated:
Created immediately after module event

Validated:
Region confirmed private executable memory

Confirmed:
Controlled test reproduced behavior
```

---

# 183. EMERGENCY SAFETY CONTROL

Provide:

```text
STOP ALL OPERATIONS
```

which immediately:

```text
Cancel scans
Cancel searches
Cancel mirror generation
Cancel pending edits
Close temporary handles
Stop monitoring
Prevent queued writes
```

Any operation that has not crossed the actual write boundary SHALL be discarded.

---

# 184. SECURITY TESTING RULE

The agent SHALL prefer:

```text
OWNED TEST PROCESS
+
CONTROLLED MEMORY
+
SIMULATION
+
SNAPSHOT
+
MIRROR
```

before interacting with a real production process.

---

# 185. ADVANCED TESTING LOOP

The security development loop SHALL be:

```text
THREAT MODEL
      ↓
CREATE CONTROLLED SCENARIO
      ↓
OBSERVE
      ↓
RECORD TELEMETRY
      ↓
DETECT
      ↓
HARDEN
      ↓
REPEAT TEST
      ↓
VERIFY DETECTION
      ↓
VERIFY PREVENTION
      ↓
VERIFY RECOVERY
      ↓
DOCUMENT EVIDENCE
```

---

# 186. SECURITY COMPLETION GATE

The security subsystem SHALL NOT be marked complete until:

```text
[ ] Process anomalies detected
[ ] Module anomalies detected
[ ] DLL integrity analyzed
[ ] Memory protection analyzed
[ ] Guard-page behavior tested safely
[ ] Pointer validation tested
[ ] Offset validation tested
[ ] XOR analysis tested
[ ] Obfuscation analysis tested
[ ] Snapshot tested
[ ] Mirror tested
[ ] Differential analysis tested
[ ] Memory editing validated
[ ] Read-back verification tested
[ ] Audit logging tested
[ ] Process identity protection tested
[ ] Race-condition handling tested
[ ] Cancellation tested
[ ] Access-denied handling tested
[ ] Protected-process handling tested
[ ] False-positive handling tested
[ ] Security simulator tested
[ ] Defensive controls verified
```

---

# 187. FINAL SECURITY PRINCIPLE

The complete architecture SHALL implement:

```text
ATTACK KNOWLEDGE
      +
DEFENSIVE ENGINEERING
      +
OBSERVABILITY
      +
ZERO TRUST
      +
CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTATION
      +
EVIDENCE
```

The objective is not merely to create a memory editor.

The objective is to create a:

```text
PROCESS SECURITY LAB
+
MEMORY FORENSICS ENGINE
+
MEMORY INTEGRITY MONITOR
+
MODULE/DLL SECURITY ANALYZER
+
CONTROLLED MEMORY EDITOR
+
POINTER/OFFSET ANALYZER
+
MIRROR/SNAPSHOT ENGINE
+
OBFUSCATION ANALYZER
+
ETHICAL PENTEST PLATFORM
+
DEFENSIVE HARDENING ENGINE
```

with every offensive research capability paired with a corresponding defensive mechanism.

The governing equation is:

```text
SECURITY VALUE
=
OBSERVABILITY
+
VALIDATION
+
PREVENTION
+
DETECTION
+
CONTAINMENT
+
RECOVERY
+
VERIFIABLE EVIDENCE
```

and the governing operational rule remains:

```text
DISCOVER
→
CLASSIFY
→
VALIDATE
→
AUTHORIZE
→
ANALYZE
→
SIMULATE
→
MODIFY WHEN AUTHORIZED
→
VERIFY
→
AUDIT
→
RESTORE
```

Never replace this with an uncontrolled:

```text
DISCOVER
→
BYPASS
→
MODIFY
```

workflow.

# SKILL.md — Invasive Memory Security Research & Red-Team Layer

## 96. Mission — Invasive Security Research

This layer models the system from the perspective of an invasive red-team operator attacking an explicitly authorized target.

The objective is to discover:

* memory corruption opportunities
* unsafe memory permissions
* writable executable regions
* stale pointers
* invalid offsets
* incorrect bounds
* unsafe module mappings
* DLL/module anomalies
* unexpected memory modifications
* pointer redirection weaknesses
* mirror-state inconsistencies
* synchronization vulnerabilities
* race conditions
* insufficient authorization
* inadequate integrity verification
* weak anti-tampering controls
* insufficient detection coverage

All invasive operations MUST operate only against:

* owned software
* dedicated security laboratories
* isolated VMs
* intentionally vulnerable applications
* CTF environments
* explicitly authorized penetration-test targets

The framework MUST NOT implement stealth mechanisms intended to defeat EDR, AV, anti-cheat, protected-process controls, or other security products on systems without authorization.

---

# 97. Attacker Research Model

Model every invasive operation as:

```text
TARGET
  ↓
RECONNAISSANCE
  ↓
MEMORY DISCOVERY
  ↓
REGION CLASSIFICATION
  ↓
WEAKNESS IDENTIFICATION
  ↓
CONTROLLED MODIFICATION
  ↓
OBSERVATION
  ↓
INTEGRITY COMPARISON
  ↓
DETECTION MEASUREMENT
  ↓
RESTORATION
  ↓
EVIDENCE
```

Every test MUST record:

```text
Target identity
Process identity
Module identity
Memory region
Address
Size
Protection
Original bytes
Modified bytes
Operation type
Timestamp
Authorization context
Detection result
Restoration result
```

---

# 98. Invasive Memory Attack-Surface Enumeration

The scanner MUST enumerate and analyze, where permitted:

```text
Process address space
Virtual memory regions
Committed pages
Reserved pages
Free regions
Image mappings
Private allocations
Mapped files
Shared mappings
Heap regions
Stack regions
Thread environments
Executable regions
Writable regions
Read-only regions
Guard pages
No-access pages
Copy-on-write regions
Thread stacks
Module sections
PE image sections
Import/export metadata
Pointer-bearing regions
String-bearing regions
High-entropy regions
Potentially encoded regions
```

Each region receives:

```text
RegionRiskScore
ModificationRisk
ExecutionRisk
PointerDensity
EntropyScore
ModuleAssociation
ProtectionState
TemporalChangeRate
DetectionCoverage
```

---

# 99. Attacker Memory Discovery

The research engine SHOULD identify:

```text
Base address
Region size
Allocation base
Allocation protection
Current protection
Memory state
Memory type
Module association
Section association
Page boundaries
Architecture
Pointer width
Alignment
```

The engine MUST distinguish:

```text
Observed
Derived
Heuristic
Simulated
Unconfirmed
```

It MUST never represent a heuristic classification as a confirmed vulnerability.

---

# 100. Precise Memory Modification Model

The invasive editor SHOULD support controlled modification of:

```text
Bit
Nibble
Byte
Byte range
WORD
DWORD
QWORD
Signed integer
Unsigned integer
Float
Double
Pointer
Address
Offset
ASCII
UTF-8
UTF-16
Binary
Hexadecimal
Structured fields
```

Every modification follows:

```text
SELECT
→ READ
→ SNAPSHOT
→ VALIDATE
→ COMPARE EXPECTED VALUE
→ PROPOSE CHANGE
→ CONFIRM
→ REVALIDATE
→ WRITE
→ READ BACK
→ VERIFY
→ LOG
```

The editor MUST support expected-value protection:

```text
Expected:
AA BB CC DD

Current:
AA BB CC DD

Requested:
AA BB 11 DD

Result:
WRITE ALLOWED
```

If current data differs:

```text
WRITE BLOCKED
REASON = STALE_TARGET
```

This prevents accidentally modifying a different process version or changed memory location.

---

# 101. Byte-Level Modification

Support:

```text
Single-byte replacement
Multi-byte replacement
Pattern replacement
Range replacement
Bit-mask modification
Nibble modification
Endian conversion
Signed/unsigned conversion
```

Example conceptual operation:

```text
Original:
48 8B 05 12 34 56 78

Modified:
48 8B 05 90 90 90 90
```

The framework records the operation as a transaction rather than silently altering memory.

---

# 102. Typed Memory Modification

A selected address MAY be interpreted as:

```text
Int8
UInt8
Int16
UInt16
Int32
UInt32
Int64
UInt64
Single
Double
Pointer32
Pointer64
ASCII
UTF-8
UTF-16
```

The UI MUST show:

```text
Address
Raw bytes
Decoded value
Data type
Endian
Alignment
Region
Protection
Module
Confidence
```

Changing representation MUST NOT automatically change memory.

---

# 103. Bit and Nibble Research

The editor SHOULD provide:

```text
Bit 0
Bit 1
Bit 2
Bit 3
Bit 4
Bit 5
Bit 6
Bit 7
```

and:

```text
High nibble
Low nibble
```

Operations:

```text
SET
CLEAR
TOGGLE
MASK
COMPARE
```

Every operation records the original and resulting byte.

---

# 104. Pattern-Based Modification

Authorized laboratory testing MAY identify byte patterns and compare them against known versions.

Pattern metadata:

```text
Pattern
Mask
Expected occurrence count
Observed occurrence count
Module
Region
Address
Confidence
```

The modification engine MUST refuse ambiguous modifications unless the user explicitly selects a unique target.

Safety rule:

```text
0 matches  → no operation
1 match    → eligible
>1 matches → require explicit target selection
```

---

# 105. Pointer Research

Analyze:

```text
Direct pointers
Pointer chains
Relative pointers
RIP-relative references
Module-relative addresses
Heap pointers
Stack pointers
Structure pointers
Function pointers
Vtable pointers
```

Each pointer candidate receives:

```text
SourceAddress
PointerValue
TargetRegion
TargetModule
TargetProtection
Alignment
Validity
Depth
Confidence
```

Pointer analysis MUST distinguish:

```text
Pointer-like bytes
Valid pointer
Mapped address
Readable target
Executable target
Known module target
Unknown target
```

A numeric value resembling an address MUST NOT automatically be classified as a valid pointer.

---

# 106. Offset Analysis

The engine SHOULD calculate:

```text
Target - Base
Target - ModuleBase
Target - AllocationBase
Target - StructureBase
Target - PreviousField
```

Represent:

```text
0x000001F400000000
        ↓
ModuleBase + 0x123456
```

Offsets SHOULD be tested for:

```text
stability
alignment
region membership
version sensitivity
module relocation
architecture
```

---

# 107. Controlled Pointer-Redirection Research

For authorized test applications, simulate:

```text
Pointer A
   ↓
Object A
```

and:

```text
Pointer A
   ↓
Mirror Object
```

The simulator SHOULD allow:

```text
original target
alternate target
mirror target
null target
invalid target
delayed target
versioned target
```

The purpose is to test whether integrity controls detect invalid or unexpected pointer relationships.

Arbitrary live-process redirection MUST remain disabled unless explicitly authorized and supported by the application's test harness.

---

# 108. Mirrored Memory Architectures

Implement multiple mirror models.

## 108.1 Snapshot Mirror

```text
LIVE MEMORY
     ↓
SNAPSHOT
     ↓
MIRROR
```

Used for:

* forensic comparison
* offline editing
* rollback
* reproducibility

---

## 108.2 Differential Mirror

Store:

```text
Original
Current
Delta
Timestamp
```

Example:

```text
Address: 0x1000

Original: 11 22 33 44
Current:  11 22 AA 44
Delta:          ^^
```

---

## 108.3 Region Mirror

Mirror one complete region:

```text
Region
 ├── Metadata
 ├── Protection
 ├── Bytes
 ├── Hash
 └── Changes
```

Useful for:

```text
heap analysis
module analysis
executable-region integrity
configuration regions
```

---

## 108.4 Module Mirror

Mirror:

```text
PE headers
.text
.rdata
.data
.pdata
.reloc
.resources
custom sections
```

Compare:

```text
memory image
expected image
disk image
previous snapshot
```

---

## 108.5 Protection Mirror

Store only protection metadata:

```text
Address
Size
Original Protection
Current Protection
Transition
Timestamp
```

Detect:

```text
RX → RWX
RW → RX
RX → RW
RWX → RX
```

---

## 108.6 Typed Mirror

Store the same bytes under multiple interpretations:

```text
RAW
HEX
INT32
UINT32
FLOAT
DOUBLE
POINTER
ASCII
UTF-8
UTF-16
```

This permits analysis without modifying the live target.

---

## 108.7 Simulation Mirror

The highest-risk modifications SHOULD initially operate here.

```text
LIVE
  ↓
MIRROR
  ↓
MODIFICATION
  ↓
SIMULATION
  ↓
DETECTION TEST
```

No live memory is changed.

---

# 109. Mirror Branching

Create independent states:

```text
BASE
 ├── Branch A
 │    └── Modification A
 │
 ├── Branch B
 │    └── Modification B
 │
 └── Branch C
      └── Modification C
```

Compare:

```text
BASE ↔ A
BASE ↔ B
BASE ↔ C
A ↔ B
```

This permits controlled testing of multiple hypotheses.

---

# 110. Mirror Replay

Store:

```text
Operation ID
Address
Length
Before
After
Timestamp
Process identity
Region identity
```

Replay MUST verify that the target state still matches the expected state before applying the operation.

---

# 111. Mirror Transactions

Represent modifications as:

```text
BEGIN
SNAPSHOT
MODIFY
VALIDATE
COMMIT
```

or:

```text
BEGIN
SNAPSHOT
MODIFY
VALIDATE FAILED
ROLLBACK
```

No partial transaction should be silently treated as successful.

---

# 112. Memory Corruption Research

The laboratory simulator SHOULD model:

```text
Out-of-bounds read
Out-of-bounds write
Use-after-free
Double-free
Invalid free
Stale pointer
Null dereference
Pointer truncation
Integer overflow
Integer underflow
Signedness errors
Size calculation errors
Alignment errors
Type confusion
Structure corruption
Heap metadata corruption
Stack corruption
Function-pointer corruption
Vtable corruption
Length-field corruption
Reference-count corruption
```

The simulator SHOULD generate controlled examples rather than weaponized exploitation against arbitrary software.

---

# 113. Guard-Page Research

Test:

```text
Normal page
Guard page
No-access page
Read-only page
Read-write page
Executable page
```

Measure:

```text
Access attempt
Exception
Protection state
Detection event
Recovery
```

Guard-page tests MUST be performed against dedicated test memory or explicitly authorized applications.

---

# 114. Writable-Executable Memory Research

Identify:

```text
RWX
RW → RX
RX → RW
Private executable memory
Executable anonymous allocations
Unexpected executable regions
```

Risk score:

```text
RWX + PRIVATE + EXECUTABLE
=
HIGH RISK
```

The detector SHOULD correlate this with:

```text
module ownership
allocation history
thread start addresses
protection transitions
hash changes
process baseline
```

---

# 115. Module/DLL Invasive Research

Analyze:

```text
Loaded module
Module path
Module base
Module size
PE headers
Sections
Import table
Export table
Relocations
Signature
Hash
Memory mapping
Protection
Entry point
```

Detect:

```text
unexpected module
unknown module
path mismatch
hash mismatch
signature mismatch
module-memory mismatch
unexpected executable mapping
duplicate module
module loaded outside expected directory
```

Controlled laboratory testing MAY use a test DLL specifically created for the application.

Covert DLL injection, stealth loading, security-product evasion, or persistence mechanisms MUST NOT be implemented.

# 116. Process Invasive Research

Analyze:

```text
PID
Creation identity
Parent process
Children
Threads
Handles
Modules
Memory
Architecture

Executable path
Command line where permitted
```

Research scenarios:

```text
unexpected child process
unexpected module
unexpected thread
unexpected memory region
unexpected protection transition
unexpected executable page
unexpected process identity
unexpected resource access
```

---

# 117. Security Watchdog Testing

Instead of implementing watchdog evasion, create a watchdog-resilience laboratory.

Test whether the detector recognizes:

```text
memory modification
region protection change
module change
module hash change
unexpected process
unexpected thread
unexpected pointer
unexpected executable allocation
unexpected DLL
unexpected memory mirror
unexpected process relationship
```

For every simulated attacker action:

```text
ATTACK
 ↓
WATCHDOG
 ↓
DETECTION?
 ↓
ALERT?
 ↓
BLOCK?
 ↓
ROLLBACK?
 ↓
EVIDENCE?
```

Measure detection latency:

```text
DetectionLatency =

```

---

# 118. Anti-Tampering Research

Test defensive systems against controlled:

```text
byte modifications
metadata modifications
module modifications
protection transitions
pointer changes
region changes
configuration changes
```

Record:

```text
Detected
NotDetected
PartiallyDetected
FalsePositive
Recovered

```

---

# 119. Memory Integrity Differential Testing

Maintain:

```text
EXPECTED
CURRENT
DELTA
```

Calculate:

```text
ChangedBytes
ChangedRegions
ChangedPages
ChangedModules
ChangedProtections
ChangedPointers
```

A security finding SHOULD contain:

```text
FindingID
Target
Address
Region

After
Expected
Observed
Detection
Severity
Evidence
```

---

# 120. Memory Hashing

Support region-level integrity:

```text
Hash(region)
Hash(module)
Hash(section)
Hash(snapshot)
Hash(page)
```

Recommended conceptual hierarchy:

```text
PROCESS
 ├── MODULE
 │    ├── SECTION
 │    │    └── PAGE
 │    │         └── BYTE RANGE
```

A changed child hash MUST identify the smallest changed region possible.

---

# 121. Temporal Memory Analysis

Capture:

```text
T0
T1

```

Compare:

```text
memory changes

```

Identify:

```text
one-time modification
periodic modification
rapid modification
continuous modification
startup modification
post-module-load modification
post-thread-creation modification
```

---

# 122. Attacker Simulation Scenarios

Provide predefined laboratory scenarios:

```text
SCN-001 UnexpectedByteModification
SCN-002 MultiByteModification
SCN-003 PointerCorruption
SCN-004 InvalidOffset
SCN-005 RegionProtectionChange
SCN-006 RWXRegion
SCN-007 UnexpectedExecutableRegion

Each scenario MUST have:

```text
Threat
Precondition
Controlled Action
Expected Detection
Observed Detection

---

# 123. Exploitability Scoring

Do not equate memory anomaly with exploitable vulnerability.

Calculate separately:

```text
Exposure
Controllability
Predictability
IntegrityImpact
ExecutionImpact
PersistenceImpact
DetectionCoverage
RecoveryCapability
```

Conceptual score:

```text
Exploitability =
Exposure ×
Controllability ×
Predictability ×
Impact ×
(1 - DetectionCoverage)
```

The score is a research heuristic, not a proof of exploitability.

---

# 124. Attacker-to-Defender Coverage Matrix

Every offensive test MUST map to defensive coverage:

| Attacker Test      | Detector            | Preventer          | Containment       | Recovery     |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------ |
| Byte modification  | Integrity monitor   | Read-only design   | Process isolation | Restore      |
| Pointer corruption | Pointer validator   | Safe ownership     | Terminate/contain | Reinitialize |
| RWX region         | Protection monitor  | W^X                | Block transition  | Restore      |
| DLL anomaly        | Module monitor      | Signing policy     | Quarantine        | Reload       |
| Region drift       | Memory baseline     | Allocation policy  | Alert             | Restore      |
| Mirror divergence  | Snapshot comparison | Integrity controls | Isolate           | Recover      |

No attack scenario is considered complete until its defensive observability has been measured.

---

# 125. Invasive Operation Audit

Every invasive operation MUST generate:

```text
AuditID
Timestamp
OperatorContext
ProcessIdentity
ModuleIdentity
Region
Address
Length
Operation
OriginalDataHash
ModifiedDataHash
Authorization
Result
DetectionResult
RollbackResult
```

Sensitive raw memory contents SHOULD be minimized in logs unless explicitly required for an authorized forensic test.

---

# 126. Fail-Closed Invasive Controls

The invasive engine MUST refuse operations when:

```text
target identity changed
process exited
region disappeared
region protection changed unexpectedly
address is outside region
requested range overflows
expected bytes mismatch
architecture mismatch
authorization missing
target is not a laboratory/authorized target
operation is ambiguous
rollback state unavailable
```

Default:

```text
UNKNOWN → DENY
```

---

# 127. Security Watchdog Resilience

The framework SHOULD evaluate whether a watchdog survives:

```text
high-frequency memory changes
rapid region transitions
module churn
multiple simultaneous modifications
mirror divergence
pointer changes
process-tree changes
```

The purpose is to test:

```text
coverage
latency
stability
false negatives
false positives
recovery
```

It MUST NOT implement watchdog evasion.

---

# 128. Invasive Research Output

Every test produces:

```text
TARGET
THREAT
ATTACK-SIMULATION
MEMORY-STATE
MODIFICATION
DETECTION
EVIDENCE
RISK
REMEDIATION
VERIFICATION
```

Example:

```text
TARGET:
AuthorizedTestProcess.exe

THREAT:
Unexpected executable writable region

OBSERVED:
Private RWX region detected

MODIFICATION:
Controlled laboratory modification

DETECTION:
YES

LATENCY:
37 ms

CONTAINMENT:
YES

RECOVERY:
YES

RESULT:
DEFENSE PASSED
```

---

# 129. Red-Team Completion Gate

An invasive security test is complete only when:

```text
[✓] Target authorized
[✓] Target identity verified
[✓] Initial memory snapshot captured
[✓] Region classified
[✓] Modification documented
[✓] Expected state recorded
[✓] Controlled operation executed
[✓] Detection measured
[✓] Evidence preserved
[✓] State restored
[✓] Restoration verified
[✓] Defensive mapping completed
[✓] Findings classified
```

---

# 130. Hard Boundary

This framework may become extremely capable for:

```text
memory inspection
memory integrity testing
controlled modification
memory corruption research
mirror simulation
pointer analysis
module analysis
DLL security testing
process security testing
anti-tampering validation
watchdog resilience testing
forensic comparison
red-team laboratory research
```

It MUST NOT become an operational framework for:

```text
EDR/AV bypass
anti-cheat bypass
protected-process circumvention
credential theft
covert persistence
stealth injection
security-tool disabling
unauthorized process modification
unauthorized DLL injection
kernel exploitation
privilege escalation
evasion of monitoring
```

The attacker perspective is therefore implemented as a **controlled adversarial laboratory model**:

```text
ATTACKER ACTION
      ↓
CONTROLLED TARGET
      ↓
OBSERVABLE MODIFICATION
      ↓
DETECTION
      ↓
CONTAINMENT
      ↓
RECOVERY
      ↓
VERIFICATION
```

This provides maximum useful invasive security research while preserving a verifiable authorization boundary.

# 46. Port Audit Safety

Require explicit target selection.

Display:

```text
TARGET
SCOPE
PORT RANGE
PROTOCOL
START
```

Never silently scan arbitrary external hosts.

---

# 47. Local Host Port Inventory

Provide a low-impact view of locally observed/listening services:

```text
Local Address
Port
Protocol
State
Process
PID
Executable
```

Where OS permissions allow.

---

# 48. Network Inventory

Display:

```text
Interface
Gateway
DNS
ARP/Neighbor Cache
Local Endpoints
Observed Peers
Observed Services
```

Clearly distinguish:

```text
OS-derived
PACKET-derived
INFERRED
UNKNOWN
```

---

# 49. Packet Security Indicators

Detect analytical indicators such as:

```text
Malformed headers
Invalid lengths
Unexpected flags
Checksum failures
Unusual fragmentation
Rapid connection churn
Repeated resets
Unexpected DNS
Unexpected gateway
ARP inconsistency
Unusual broadcast rate
Unusual multicast rate
Unexpected protocol
Large bursts
```

These are indicators requiring investigation, not automatic proof of attack.

---

# 50. Packet Integrity

For each packet:

```text
Captured Length
Original Length
Checksum State
Decoder State
Malformed State
Reassembly State
```

Possible:

```text
VALID
INVALID
NOT_CHECKED
NOT_APPLICABLE
UNKNOWN
```

---

# 51. Capture Statistics

Display:

```text
Captured
Accepted
Filtered
Dropped
Malformed
Decoded
Unknown
Reassembled
```

This prevents HERMES from claiming complete visibility when packets were dropped.

---

# 52. Capture Filter

Provide efficient pre-filtering before UI rendering.

Separate:

```text
Capture Filter
Display Filter
```

Capture filter reduces processing.

Display filter changes only what is shown.

---

# 53. Filter History

Store:

```text
Filter Name
Expression
Creation Time
Last Used
Packet Count
```

Allow:

```text
Save
Load
Rename
Delete
Favorite
```

---

# 54. Packet Bookmarks

Allow:

```text
Bookmark Packet
Bookmark Connection
Bookmark Stream
Bookmark Address
Bookmark Threat
```

Bookmarks survive snapshot export.

---

# 55. Network Snapshots

Create:

```text
NetworkSnapshot
```

containing:

```text
Adapter metadata
Capture metadata
Packet metadata
Connections
Statistics
Alerts
Timeline
Filters
```

---

# 56. Offline Analysis

Allow loading previously captured authorized packet captures.

Modes:

```text
Read-only
Forensic
Protocol analysis
Statistics
Threat analysis
Comparison
```

Offline files MUST NOT be treated as live network traffic.

---

# 57. Capture Comparison

Compare:

```text
Capture A
VS
Capture B
```

Detect:

```text
New IPs
Removed IPs
New Ports
Removed Ports
Protocol changes
Traffic changes
Connection changes
DNS changes
MAC changes
Gateway changes
```

---

# 58. Network Baseline

Create:

```text
NetworkBaseline
```

Record:

```text
Known interfaces
Known gateways
Known DNS
Known MACs
Known peers
Known ports
Known protocols
Known traffic patterns
```

Detect deviations.

---

# 59. Network Protection Mode

Add:

```text
Network Protection
```

which monitors the selected interface/host for configured anomalies.

States:

```text
OFF
MONITOR
WARN
STRICT
```

Protection SHALL primarily detect and alert rather than silently manipulate network traffic.

---

# 60. NEW — Packet Laboratory

Create a separate submenu:

```text
Laboratory
```

with:

```text
Packet Sandbox
Packet Decoder
Packet Builder
Fragment/Reassembly Lab
Stream Lab
Protocol Test Lab
Malformed-Packet Lab
```

The laboratory operates on:

```text
COPIED PACKET
SNAPSHOT
SYNTHETIC PACKET
```

not arbitrary live traffic.

---

# 61. Packet Sandbox

Workflow:

```text
Captured Packet
      ↓
Clone
      ↓
Sandbox
      ↓
Modify
      ↓
Decode
      ↓
Validate
      ↓
Compare
```

No automatic transmission.

---

# 62. Safe Packet Manipulation

The sandbox may allow changing fields for analysis:

```text
Source MAC
Destination MAC
Source IP
Destination IP
Ports
TTL
Flags
Payload
Protocol fields
```

Then recompute/check:

```text
Length
Offsets
Checksums
Protocol validity
```

The result is explicitly labeled:

```text
SIMULATION
```

---

# 63. Fragmentation Laboratory

Allow a synthetic/captured packet to be split into simulated fragments.

Display:

```text
Original
Fragment 1
Fragment 2
Fragment 3
...
Reassembled
```

Test:

```text
Normal
Missing fragment
Out-of-order fragment
Overlap
Malformed length
```

This is for decoder and defensive testing only.

---

# 64. Packet Mutation Testing

Provide safe mutation operators:

```text
Change field
Remove field
Duplicate field
Truncate payload
Alter length
Alter checksum
Reorder synthetic fragments
Insert malformed header
```

Result:

```text
VALID
INVALID
DECODER ERROR
EXPECTED REJECTION
UNEXPECTED ACCEPTANCE
```

---

# 65. Defensive Exploit Simulation

Replace live exploitation with:

```text
Packet Threat Simulation
```

Examples:

```text
Malformed packet
Invalid length
Fragment anomaly
Unexpected redirect indicator
Protocol parser boundary case
Checksum mismatch
Unexpected flags
```

The system reports:

```text
Detector
Expected Detection
Observed Detection
Evidence
Remediation
```

No live exploitation is performed.

---

# 66. Packet Mutation Audit

Every sandbox modification records:

```text
Original Hash
Modified Hash
Field Changed
Old Value
New Value
Timestamp
Simulation ID
```

---

# 67. Packet Hashing

Calculate:

```text
SHA-256
SHA-512
MD5
CRC32
```

where appropriate.

Cryptographic hashes SHALL be clearly distinguished from protocol checksums.

---

# 68. Packet Export

Support:

```text
Raw Binary
Hex
JSON
CSV
TXT
HTML
Markdown
PCAP
```

Exports SHALL identify whether data is:

```text
LIVE CAPTURE
SNAPSHOT
OFFLINE
SIMULATION
```

---

# 69. Multi-Window Network Workspace

Opening a packet SHALL support:

```text
Open Packet Window
Open Connection Window
Open Stream Window
Open Protocol Window
Open Threat Window
Open Hex Window
```

Example:

```text
Network Explorer
      |
      +── Packet #18421
      |     +── Ethernet
      |     +── IPv4
      |     +── TCP
      |     +── TLS
      |
      +── Connection
      |
      +── Stream
      |
      +── Threat Analysis
```

---

# 70. Network Window Synchronization

Create:

```text
NetworkSelectionBus
```

Selecting a packet updates:

```text
Packet Detail
Hex View
Decoded Output
Connection
Stream
Timeline
Threat Console
Statistics
```

Selecting a connection filters packets automatically.

---

# 71. Command Palette

Network commands:

```text
Open Network Explorer
Select Adapter

# 73. Npcap Abstraction

Do not scatter native capture calls across the GUI.

Use:

```text
INetworkCaptureService
```

with operations conceptually equivalent to:

```text
EnumerateAdapters
OpenAdapter
StartCapture
PauseCapture
StopCapture
ReadPacket
ApplyCaptureFilter
CloseAdapter
```

The UI communicates only with the service.

---

# 74. Capture Threading

Capture SHALL NEVER block the UI thread.

Architecture:

```text
Npcap
  ↓
Capture Worker
  ↓
Packet Queue
  ↓
Decoder Worker
  ↓
Analysis Worker
  ↓
UI Dispatcher
```

Use:

```text
CancellationToken
ConcurrentQueue
Bounded buffers
Batch UI updates
Backpressure
```

---

# 75. Capture Backpressure

When packet rate exceeds UI capacity:

```text
Capture
   ↓
Queue
   ↓
Decoder
   ↓
Analyzer
   ↓
UI
```

the UI SHALL NOT attempt to render every packet individually.

Use:

```text
Batching
Virtualization
Aggregation
Sampling for graphs
```

Raw packets remain separately available where captured.

---

# 76. Privacy

Network payloads can contain sensitive information.

Provide:

```text
Payload Display ON/OFF
Payload Storage ON/OFF
Address Redaction
Export Redaction
Capture Retention
```

Default to metadata-first presentation.

---

# 77. Truthfulness Rules

HERMES MUST distinguish:

```text
CAPTURED
DECODED
REASSEMBLED
INFERRED
HEURISTIC
SIMULATED
UNKNOWN
```

Never display:

```text
"DECODED"
```

when only a port-based guess exists.

Use:

```text
LIKELY HTTP
```

or:

```text
PORT-BASED PROTOCOL HYPOTHESIS
```

when evidence is insufficient.

---

# 78. Network Security Evidence

Every alert SHALL provide:

```text
What happened
When
Interface
Packet
Connection
Evidence
Detection method
Confidence
Related events
Recommended investigation
```

---

# 79. Network Audit Log

Record:

```text
Capture Started
Capture Stopped
Adapter Selected
Filter Applied
Packet Exported
Snapshot Created
Baseline Created
Threat Detected
Port Audit Started
Port Audit Finished
Simulation Started

```

---

# 80. Network Dashboard

Create cards:

```text
Packets
Bytes
Packets/sec

High Alerts
Critical Alerts

Malformed
```

Charts:

```text

```

---

# 81. Final Network Explorer Model

The complete module SHALL operate as:

# 82. Final Copilot Directive

When generating this subsystem:

```text
DO NOT create:
A single packet-list demo.

CREATE:
A complete graphical network-analysis workstation.
```

The minimum implementation is:

```text
✓ Npcap adapter discovery
✓ Live packet capture
✓ Packet table
✓ Packet detail window
✓ Ethernet decoder
✓ IPv4 decoder
✓ IPv6 decoder
✓ TCP decoder
✓ UDP decoder
✓ ICMP decoder
✓ DNS decoder
✓ DHCP decoder
✓ TLS metadata
✓ HTTP metadata
✓ Hex viewer
✓ Raw output console
✓ Connection explorer
✓ Stream inspector
✓ Input filter
✓ Output filter
✓ Forward filter
✓ Port filter
✓ IP filter
✓ MAC filter
✓ Protocol filter
✓ Traffic filter
✓ Complex filter
✓ Packet statistics
✓ Network timeline
✓ Process/network correlation
✓ Network baseline
✓ Threat console
✓ Redirect anomaly analysis
✓ Authorized port auditing
✓ Network snapshots
✓ Offline analysis
✓ Packet comparison
✓ Packet laboratory
✓ Packet mutation simulation
✓ Fragment/reassembly simulation
✓ Packet integrity testing
✓ Export
✓ Audit
✓ Multi-window synchronization
✓ Async capture
✓ Backpressure
✓ Privacy controls
✓ Evidence classification
```

The packet-manipulation area SHALL remain a **sandbox/laboratory** rather than a live packet-redirection, packet-injection, exploitation, or evasion mechanism.

---

# 83. Prime Network Principle

```text
CAPTURE
   ↓
PRESERVE RAW DATA
   ↓
DECODE
   ↓
CORRELATE
   ↓

   ↓
ANALYZE
   ↓
BASELINE
   ↓
DETECT

```

HERMES Network Explorer SHALL therefore provide deep visibility into authorized network traffic while maintaining a strict separation between:

```text
REAL NETWORK DATA
```

and:

```text
LABORATORY/SIMULATED PACKETS
```

so that every displayed result has a clear and verifiable provenance.

# SKILL.md — HERMES Network-to-Process Memory Correlation & Controlled Mutation

## Skill Identity

**Name:** `hermes-network-process-memory-correlation`

**Platform:** Windows 10/11

**Language:** Visual Basic .NET / .NET

**Application:** HERMES Process Explorer + HERMES Network Explorer

**Primary Role:** Defensive systems-analysis engineer

**Purpose:**

Create a controlled architecture connecting:

```text
NETWORK PACKET
      ↓
PACKET DECODER
      ↓
NETWORK EVENT
      ↓
PROCESS / CONNECTION CORRELATION
      ↓
TARGET PROCESS
      ↓
MODULE / SUBMODULE
      ↓
MEMORY REGION
      ↓
MEMORY OBSERVATION
      ↓
AUTHORIZED TEST MUTATION
      ↓
INTEGRITY / BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
```

The system must distinguish between:

* captured data
* decoded information
* process correlation
* inferred relationships
* authorized memory changes
* simulated memory changes
* observed consequences

The network layer must **never implicitly gain unrestricted ability to modify arbitrary processes**.

# 1. Core Concept

HERMES combines two previously independent workspaces:

```text
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│      HERMES NETWORK EXPLORER  │
│                               │

```

# 2. Security Boundary

The architecture MUST separate three modes.

## MODE A — OBSERVE

Network data can:

* capture packets
* decode packets
* identify connections
* correlate endpoints
* identify associated processes where Windows telemetry permits
* locate candidate memory regions for investigation

It cannot modify memory.

```text
Packet → Correlation → Observation
```

---

## MODE B — SIMULATION

Network packets can be copied into an isolated simulation environment.

Example:

```text
Captured Packet
      ↓
Packet Clone
      ↓
Synthetic Network Event
      ↓
Test Process
      ↓
Synthetic Memory Model
      ↓
Simulated Modification
```

The resulting modification is recorded as:

```text
SIMULATED
```

and cannot escape into an arbitrary production process.

---

## MODE C — AUTHORIZED TEST

Memory modification is available only when all required authorization conditions are satisfied.

Required:

```text
Explicit user action
+
Allowlisted target
+
Known process identity
+
Known memory region
+
Writable/test-designated region
+
Mutation preview
+
Confirmation
+
Audit record
```

Never allow:

```text
packet → arbitrary PID → arbitrary address → automatic write
```

---

# 3. Network-to-Process Correlation

Implement:

```text
NetworkProcessCorrelationEngine
```

Responsibilities:

1. Receive decoded packet.
2. Identify network flow.
3. Identify endpoint.
4. Resolve local socket information.
5. Correlate socket with process.
6. Resolve PID.
7. Resolve process name.
8. Resolve process path where permitted.
9. Resolve module ownership.
10. Associate the network event with a process object.
11. Associate candidate memory regions.
12. Produce an evidence record.

Example:

```text
Packet
 ├── Source IP
 ├── Destination IP
 ├── Source Port
 ├── Destination Port
 ├── Protocol
 └── Timestamp

        ↓

Connection

        ↓

PID

        ↓

Process

        ↓

Module

        ↓

Memory Region
```

---

# 4. Important Correlation Rule

Network correlation does NOT automatically prove causality.

The interface must distinguish:

```text
CAPTURED
DECODED
CORRELATED
INFERRED
SIMULATED
AUTHORIZED
MODIFIED
```

Example:

```text
TCP connection → PID 4216
```

means:

```text
CORRELATED
```

It does not automatically mean:

```text
packet caused process memory modification
```

The UI must never represent inference as fact.

---

# 5. Process Explorer Integration

Add:

```text
Network Activity
```

to every compatible process.

Process tree:

```text
Process
├── Network Activity
│   ├── Connections
│   ├── Listening Ports
│   ├── Remote Endpoints
│   ├── Packets
│   └── Network Events
│
├── Modules
│   ├── EXE
│   ├── DLL
│   └── Submodules
│
└── Memory
    ├── Image
    ├── Private
    ├── Mapped
    ├── Shared
    ├── Guard
    └── Other
```

Selecting a network connection must optionally highlight the associated process.

---

# 6. Network Explorer → Process Explorer

Add context menu:

```text
Packet
 ├── Inspect Packet
 ├── Decode Packet
 ├── Follow Connection
 ├── Follow Stream
 ├── Find Associated Process
 ├── Open Process Explorer
 └── Analyze Process Memory
```

For a connection:

```text
Connection
 ├── Process
 ├── PID
 ├── Executable
 ├── Module
 ├── Network Timeline
 └── Memory Timeline
```

---

# 7. Process → Network Explorer

Add context menu:

```text
Process
 ├── Network Activity
 ├── Active Connections
 ├── Listening Ports
 ├── Remote Endpoints
 ├── Packet Timeline
 ├── Protocol Distribution
 └── Open Network Explorer
```

---

# 8. Module → Network Explorer

Each module can expose:

```text
Module
├── Network Connections
├── Related Processes
├── Network Events
├── First Network Activity
├── Last Network Activity
└── Correlation Confidence
```

The association should be marked:

```text
DIRECT
CORRELATED
INFERRED
UNKNOWN
```

---

# 9. Memory Zone Correlation

A packet may be associated with a process, but the system must not assume that the packet maps directly to an address.

Instead use:

```text
Packet
 ↓
Flow
 ↓
Process
 ↓
Module
 ↓
Candidate Memory Region
 ↓
Evidence
```

Candidate regions can be identified through:

* known application state
* controlled test instrumentation
* memory snapshots
* application-defined telemetry
* explicit user-selected regions
* synthetic test mappings
* deterministic laboratory mappings

---

# 10. Memory Correlation Object

Implement:

```vb
Public Class MemoryCorrelation

    Public Property ProcessId As Integer

    Public Property ProcessName As String

    Public Property ModuleName As String

    Public Property RegionBase As IntPtr

    Public Property RegionSize As Long

    Public Property Protection As String

    Public Property PacketId As Long

    Public Property ConnectionId As String

    Public Property Confidence As String

    Public Property Evidence As String

    Public Property Mode As String

End Class
```

---

# 11. Network Event Object

```vb
Public Class NetworkMemoryEvent

    Public Property EventId As Guid

    Public Property Timestamp As DateTime

    Public Property PacketId As Long

    Public Property ProcessId As Integer

    Public Property ProcessName As String

    Public Property MemoryRegion As String

    Public Property EventType As String

    Public Property Confidence As String

    Public Property Simulation As Boolean

    Public Property Authorized As Boolean

    Public Property Description As String

End Class
```

# 12. Packet → Memory Laboratory

Create a dedicated window:

```text

# 13. Packet Transformation

The laboratory may create a transformed packet:

```text
Original Packet
       ↓
Clone
       ↓
Transformation
       ↓
Decode
       ↓
Validate
       ↓
Compare
```

Allowed laboratory transformations include:

```text
Byte replacement
Field replacement
Length variation
Payload replacement
Flag variation
Fragmentation simulation
Fragment reordering
Checksum alteration
Header corruption
Protocol boundary testing
```

The transformed packet must initially remain an in-memory object.

It must NOT automatically be transmitted.

---

# 14. Packet-to-Memory Simulation

For controlled experiments:

```text
Packet Field
      ↓
Mapping Rule
      ↓
Synthetic Memory Target
      ↓
Transformation
      ↓
Result
```

Example conceptual mapping:

```text
Packet field:
ApplicationValue

Mapping:

ApplicationValue
        ↓
TestProcess.StateBuffer
        ↓
Offset + 0x20
```

This is a **test mapping**, not an exploit primitive.

---

# 15. Explicit Memory Target Mapping

Create:

```vb
Public Class MemoryTargetMapping

    Public Property MappingId As Guid

    Public Property ProcessId As Integer

    Public Property ModuleName As String

    Public Property RegionName As String

    Public Property Offset As Long

    Public Property Length As Integer

    Public Property SourcePacketField As String

    Public Property Enabled As Boolean

    Public Property SimulationOnly As Boolean

End Class
```

Example:

```text
Packet Field:
Temperature

Target:
HERMES-TestProcess

Region:
SimulationBuffer

Offset:
0x20

Length:
4

Mode:
SIMULATION
```

---

# 16. Mapping Safety

A mapping must fail closed when:

```text
PID changed
Process exited
Module changed
Region changed
Region protection changed
Region size changed
Expected hash changed
Target not allowlisted
Simulation flag missing
Authorization missing
```

Result:

```text
MEMORY MUTATION BLOCKED
```

---

# 17. Memory Snapshot Before Mutation

Before an authorized test mutation:

```text
Capture:
 ├── Process identity
 ├── PID
 ├── Module
 ├── Region base
 ├── Region size
 ├── Protection
 ├── Original bytes
 ├── SHA-256
 └── Timestamp
```

Then calculate:

```text
BEFORE HASH
     ↓
TEST MUTATION
     ↓
AFTER HASH
```

---

# 18. Mutation Preview

Never modify immediately after packet selection.

Show:

```text
TARGET
Process: HERMES-TestProcess

MODULE
TestModule.dll

REGION
SimulationBuffer

OFFSET
0x20

OLD VALUE
00 00 00 00

NEW VALUE
7B 00 00 00

SOURCE

```

Buttons:

```text

# 19. Difference Viewer

Provide:

```text
OFFSET       BEFORE       AFTER
--------------------------------
00000020     00           7B
00000021     00           00
00000022     00           00
00000023     00           00
```

Interpretation:

```text
BYTE
UINT16
UINT32
UINT64
FLOAT
DOUBLE
ASCII
UTF-8
HEX
```

---

# 20. Process Memory Protection Awareness

The Process Explorer must classify regions:

```text
READ
READWRITE
EXECUTE
EXECUTE_READ
EXECUTE_READWRITE
GUARD
NOACCESS
COPY_ON_WRITE
MAPPED
PRIVATE
IMAGE
```

The network correlation system must treat:

```text
EXECUTABLE CODE
READ-ONLY
GUARD
PROTECTED
SYSTEM-OWNED
UNKNOWN
```

as protected analytical regions.

Do not silently change protection merely to make a mutation succeed.

---

# 21. Module Protection

Each module receives:

```text
Module Integrity
 ├── Original Hash
 ├── Current Hash
 ├── Timestamp
 ├── Base Address
 ├── Size
 ├── Sections
 ├── Protection
 └── Network Associations
```

Possible states:

```text
UNCHANGED
CHANGED
UNEXPECTED CHANGE
UNKNOWN
```

---

# 22. Submodule Correlation

Represent nested components:

```text
Process
 └── MainModule
      ├── Section
      ├── DLL
      │    ├── Export
      │    └── Region
      └── Mapped Component
```

Network events can be attached to the highest-confidence known component.

---

# 23. Network Event Timeline + Memory Timeline

Create synchronized timelines:

```text
NETWORK TIMELINE

12:01:01 Packet
12:01:02 Packet
12:01:03 Connection event
12:01:04 Packet
12:01:05 Response


MEMORY TIMELINE

12:01:01 Snapshot
12:01:03 Change detected
12:01:04 Snapshot
12:01:05 Hash changed
```

Display temporal relationships without claiming causation unless independently established.

---

# 24. Causality Analysis

Implement:

```text
CausalityAnalyzer
```

Inputs:

```text
Network timestamp
Process event timestamp
Memory snapshot timestamp
Thread activity
Module activity
Application telemetry
```

Output:

```text
TEMPORAL MATCH
POSSIBLE CORRELATION
STRONG CORRELATION
NO CORRELATION
INSUFFICIENT DATA
```

The analyzer must never convert temporal proximity into proof of causation.

---

# 25. Process Memory Watchpoints

Allow user-selected watch regions:

```text
Watch Region
 ├── Base
 ├── Length
 ├── Data Type
 ├── Initial Hash
 ├── Current Hash
 ├── Last Change
 └── Related Network Events
```

When a watched region changes:

```text
Memory Change
      ↓
Search nearby process events
      ↓
Search network timeline
      ↓
Correlate timestamps
      ↓
Display evidence
```

---

# 26. Network-Triggered Test Harness

Create:

```text
NetworkTriggeredTestHarness
```

The harness should operate on a dedicated test process.

Architecture:

```text
Npcap
 ↓
Packet Decoder
 ↓
Network Event
 ↓
Test Harness
 ↓
Allowlisted Test Process
 ↓
Test Memory Buffer
 ↓
Controlled Mutation
 ↓
Verification
```

Example:

```text
Packet:
TEST_COMMAND = SET_VALUE

        ↓

Test Harness

        ↓

TestProcess.TestBuffer

        ↓

Expected value changed

        ↓

Verification
```

---

# 27. Synthetic Test Process

HERMES should include an optional process:

```text
HERMES-TestTarget.exe
```

with clearly defined memory structures:

```text
TestState
 ├── Counter
 ├── FloatValue
 ├── DoubleValue
 ├── ByteBuffer
 ├── TextBuffer
 └── Signature
```

This gives the Network Explorer a safe target for demonstrating:

```text
network event
      ↓
application event
      ↓
memory state change
```

without targeting unrelated applications.

---

# 28. Test Process Protocol

The test application can expose an intentionally documented local test interface.

Example logical protocol:

```text
HERMES-TEST

COMMAND
SET_COUNTER

VALUE
1234

TARGET
Counter
```

HERMES then verifies:

```text
Packet
 ↓
Decoder
 ↓
Validation
 ↓
Test command
 ↓
Test process
 ↓
Expected state
```

All operations are recorded.

---

# 29. Network Event Bus

Implement:

```vb
Public Interface INetworkProcessEventBus

    Event NetworkEventReceived As EventHandler(Of NetworkMemoryEvent)

    Sub Publish(evt As NetworkMemoryEvent)

End Interface
```

Consumers:

```text
Network Explorer
Process Explorer
Memory Explorer
Timeline
Threat Engine
Audit Engine
Test Harness
```

---

# 30. Selection Synchronization

Implement:

```text
NetworkSelectionBus
```

Supported selection types:

```text
Packet
Connection
Stream
Process
Module
MemoryRegion
NetworkEvent
```

Example:

```text
Select Packet #1024

→ Connection highlighted
→ PID highlighted
→ Process selected
→ Module selected
→ Candidate memory regions highlighted
```

---

# 31. Multi-Window Synchronization

Windows:

```text
Network Explorer
Process Explorer
Memory Explorer
Packet Detail
Connection Explorer
Memory Timeline
Network Timeline
Threat Console
Memory Laboratory
Packet Laboratory
```

All communicate through:

```text
HermesSelectionBus
HermesEventBus
HermesAuditBus
```

---

# 32. Network Event Log

Each event:

```text
Timestamp
Packet ID
Connection ID
Process ID
Process Name
Module
Memory Region
Event Type
Confidence
Mode
Authorization
Result
```

Example:

```text
16:04:21
Packet #1821
TCP
PID 4216
HERMES-TestTarget.exe
TestModule
SimulationBuffer
SIMULATED_MEMORY_CHANGE
SIMULATION
SUCCESS
```

---

# 33. Security States

Every operation receives a state:

```text
OBSERVE
ANALYZE
SIMULATE
PREVIEW
AUTHORIZED_TEST
BLOCKED
FAILED
```

Never silently transition:

```text
OBSERVE → MODIFY
```

---

# 34. Authorization Gate

Implement:

```text
MemoryMutationAuthorizationService
```

Validation:

```text
IsSimulation?
IsTargetAllowlisted?
IsProcessKnown?
IsRegionKnown?
IsRegionExpected?
IsUserInitiated?
IsPreviewApproved?
IsIntegrityValid?
```

Only if all required checks pass:

```text
AUTHORIZED_TEST
```

Otherwise:

```text
BLOCKED
```

---

# 35. Rollback

For controlled test targets:

```text
Snapshot
 ↓
Mutation
 ↓
Verification
 ↓
Rollback
 ↓
Verification
```

Verify:

```text
original bytes
original hash
target identity
region identity
```

before restoring.

---

# 36. Immutable Audit Trail

Record:

```text
Operation ID
Timestamp
Operator action
Packet hash
Original packet hash
Transformed packet hash
Process identity
Module identity
Region identity
Original memory hash
Resulting memory hash
Authorization state
Simulation state
Rollback state
```

---

# 37. Hashing

Support:

```text
SHA-256
SHA-512
MD5
CRC32
```

Distinguish clearly:

```text
CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH
```

from:

```text
CHECKSUM
```

Never describe CRC as equivalent to SHA-256 integrity protection.

---

# 38. Memory Modification Audit

For every test modification:

```text
MEMORY MUTATION

Process:
HERMES-TestTarget.exe

Module:
TestModule.dll

Region:
SimulationBuffer

Offset:
0x20

Before:
00 00 00 00

After:
7B 00 00 00

Source:
Packet #1842

Packet SHA-256:
...

Mode:
AUTHORIZED_TEST

Result:
SUCCESS
```

---

# 39. Packet Manipulation Laboratory

The Packet Laboratory may contain:

```text
Packet Builder
Packet Decoder
Packet Mutator
Fragmentation Simulator
Stream Simulator
Protocol Test Harness
```

Operations remain isolated from unrestricted live transmission.

---

# 40. Defensive Mutation Tests

Supported scenarios:

```text
Invalid length
Invalid checksum
Malformed header
Unexpected flags
Fragment boundary
Fragment reordering
Truncated payload
Oversized field
Unexpected protocol value
Malformed application metadata
```

Expected result:

```text
ACCEPT
REJECT
ALERT
DECODER ERROR
UNKNOWN
```

---

# 41. Memory Integrity Detection

When a network event coincides with a memory change:

```text
Network Event
     ↓
Memory Watchpoint
     ↓
Hash Comparison
     ↓
Process State
     ↓
Module State
     ↓
Evidence Record
```

Generate:

```text
MEMORY CHANGE CORRELATED WITH NETWORK EVENT
```

rather than:

```text
NETWORK PACKET MODIFIED MEMORY
```

unless the controlled test harness itself explicitly produced that result.

---

# 42. Threat Detection

Detect suspicious relationships such as:

```text
Unexpected network activity
+
Unexpected process
+
Unexpected module
+
Unexpected memory change
```

Risk levels:

```text
INFO
NOTICE
SUSPICIOUS
HIGH
CRITICAL
```

The system must show the evidence supporting the classification.

---

# 43. Network → Process Threat View

Example:

```text
NETWORK
192.168.1.20:443
       ↓
CONNECTION
       ↓
PID 4216
       ↓
PROCESS
       ↓
MODULE
       ↓
MEMORY REGION
       ↓
CHANGE DETECTED
```

Display:

```text
Confidence: 87%
Evidence:
- endpoint matched
- PID matched
- timestamp proximity
- watch region changed
- module unchanged
```

---

# 44. Defensive Reverse Engineering Mode

The system can investigate:

```text
Packet
 ↓
Protocol
 ↓
Connection
 ↓
Process
 ↓
Module
 ↓
Memory
```

and reverse the direction:

```text
Memory Change
 ↓
Process Event
 ↓
Network Connection
 ↓
Packet Timeline
 ↓
Protocol
```

This creates bidirectional forensic navigation.

---

# 45. Memory → Network Navigation

Memory Explorer context menu:

```text

 ├── Hash
 ├── Snapshot
 ├── Compare
 ├── Network Correlations
 ├── Related Connections
 └── Related Packets
```

# 46. Packet → Memory Navigation

Network Explorer context menu:

```text

 ├── Watch Region
 └── Open Memory Laboratory
```

---

# 47. Evidence Graph

Create a graph:

```text
[PACKET]
    │
    ▼
[CONNECTION]
    │
    ▼
[SOCKET]
    │
    ▼
[PROCESS]
    │
    ▼
[MODULE]
    │
    ▼
[MEMORY REGION]
    │
    ▼
[MEMORY CHANGE]
```

Edges must have evidence labels:

```text
DIRECT
CORRELATED
INFERRED
SIMULATED
UNKNOWN
```

---

# 48. Data Provenance

Every displayed value receives provenance:

```text
CAPTURED
DECODED
CORRELATED
INFERRED
REASSEMBLED
SIMULATED
AUTHORIZED
UNKNOWN
```

This prevents the UI from confusing raw observations with derived conclusions.

---

# 49. Required Services

# 51. Main Architecture

```

---

# 52. Prime Safety Rule

HERMES must never implement an unrestricted primitive equivalent to:

```text
receive arbitrary packet
        ↓
extract attacker-controlled address
        ↓
extract attacker-controlled bytes
        ↓
open arbitrary process
        ↓
write arbitrary memory
```

Instead:

```text
receive packet
        ↓
decode
        ↓
correlate
        ↓
identify evidence
        ↓
select controlled test mapping
        ↓
validate authorization
        ↓
preview
        ↓
simulate or explicitly authorize
        ↓
verify
        ↓
audit
```

---

# 53. Final Design Principle

The desired HERMES concept is therefore implemented as:

```text
NETWORK
   ↓
PACKET
   ↓
PROTOCOL
   ↓
CONNECTION
   ↓
PROCESS
   ↓
MODULE
   ↓
MEMORY REGION
   ↓
OBSERVATION
   ↓
CORRELATION
   ↓
SIMULATION / AUTHORIZED TEST
   ↓
MEMORY STATE
   ↓
VERIFICATION
   ↓
AUDIT
```

The system becomes a unified **Network ↔ Process ↔ Module ↔ Memory forensic and laboratory environment**.

The critical distinction is:

```text
NETWORK PACKET ≠ AUTOMATIC MEMORY WRITE
```

Instead:

```text
NETWORK PACKET
      =
OBSERVABLE INPUT
```

and, inside the controlled laboratory:

```text
NETWORK PACKET
      ↓
TEST EVENT
      ↓
KNOWN TEST MAPPING
      ↓
KNOWN MEMORY TARGET
      ↓
CONTROLLED STATE CHANGE
```

This provides the requested packet-to-memory experimentation model while keeping arbitrary remote process modification outside the architecture.
