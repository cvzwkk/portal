Without Dogmatics    
The realm of existence can be understood as the totality of all that is, was, or can be. It encompasses everything from physical matter and energy to abstract concepts and potentialities.

Physical Reality:    
This includes the observable universe governed by natural laws, such as physics and chemistry. It is the domain of matter, space, and time, characterized by measurable phenomena and interactions.

Abstract Reality:    
Beyond the tangible, existence also includes ideas, numbers, logic, and other constructs of human thought. These abstractions, though intangible, shape and define our understanding of the physical world.

Emergent Properties:    
Existence is marked by the emergence of complex systems, such as life and consciousness, which arise from simpler components through intricate processes.

Continuum of States:    
Existence is not static but dynamicâ€”a continuum where systems evolve, interact, and transform. It is a tapestry woven from countless interdependent processes.

In this view, existence is explored through scientific inquiry, philosophical reasoning, and the recognition of patterns and systems, without presupposing intrinsic meaning or purpose.

Within Dogmatics:    
The realm of existence is often perceived as a creation or manifestation of a higher power, purpose, or cosmic order.

Divine Origin:   
Existence is attributed to the will or action of a supreme being or principle. It is seen as intentional and purposeful, reflecting a divine plan or cosmic order.

Dual Realities:    
Many dogmatic traditions distinguish between physical and metaphysical realms. The physical world is temporary and material, while the metaphysical (spiritual) realm is eternal and transcendent.

Purpose and Meaning:    
In this view, existence has an intrinsic meaning or destiny. Human life is often framed within a narrative of moral, spiritual, or cosmic significance, where individuals play a role in a larger divine or universal purpose.

Interconnection:   
The realm of existence is united under the governance or oversight of a higher intelligence, binding all aspects of life, nature, and spirit into a coherent whole.

Here, existence is not merely a descriptive state but a manifestation of deeper truths, often approached through faith, revelation, and adherence to prescribed doctrines.
