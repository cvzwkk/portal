Are you asking about what comes **after qubits** in the evolution of quantum computing? If so, there are a few speculative ideas about what could surpass qubits as the fundamental unit of quantum information processing. Here are some possibilities:  

### **1. Qutrits and Higher-Dimensional Qudits**  
- **Qutrits** (three-level quantum systems) and **qudits** (multi-level quantum systems) generalize qubits and can store more information per unit.  
- They could lead to more efficient quantum algorithms and denser quantum error correction.  

### **2. Topological Qubits**  
- These are based on exotic particles like **anyons** (e.g., Majorana zero modes).  
- They have **intrinsic error resistance**, making them highly stable for quantum computing.  
- Microsoftâ€™s **topological quantum computing** project is based on this idea.  

### **3. Photonic Quantum Computing & Continuous Variables (CV-QC)**  
- Instead of discrete qubits, photonic systems can use **continuous quantum states** of light (e.g., squeezed states).  
- Could lead to scalable and room-temperature quantum computing.  

### **4. Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) & Quantum Cognition**  
- Some theories explore **self-organizing quantum systems** that evolve beyond classical computational models.  
- Quantum neural networks could be a bridge between **AI and quantum mechanics**.  

### **5. Post-Quantum Theories: Quantum Gravity & Beyond**  
- Some physicists speculate that the next stage of computation may involve **holographic computing** or **quantum gravity-inspired information processing** (e.g., black hole information paradox studies).  
- Concepts like **"spacetime as a computation"** could lead to new paradigms.
