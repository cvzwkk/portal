It sounds like you're exploring ideas related to the infinite nature of spacetime and how size and weight are influenced by changes in empty space. Here are a few angles to consider:  

1. **Infinite Spacetime**  
   If spacetime is infinite, it suggests that there is no absolute boundary—only regions of different densities, curvatures, and energy states. General relativity describes spacetime as a flexible fabric that bends due to mass and energy, meaning that even "empty" space can still have properties like vacuum energy and quantum fluctuations.  

2. **Empty Space and Influence on Size & Weight**  
   - *Size:* If spacetime is affected by energy or expansion (such as in cosmic inflation), then the perceived size of objects can change due to metric expansion or contraction.  
   - *Weight:* Gravity is a curvature of spacetime, meaning the presence or absence of mass influences how weight is perceived. If "empty" space fluctuates due to dark energy or quantum effects, the gravitational pull an object experiences could change as well.  

3. **Quantum Vacuum and Virtual Particles**  
   Even "empty" space isn't truly empty—it contains quantum fluctuations where virtual particles pop in and out of existence. These fluctuations might contribute to the effects we observe in spacetime, potentially influencing how mass behaves on the smallest scales.  

Are you thinking about this in a physics sense, a philosophical sense, or something else?
