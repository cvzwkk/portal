Pocket universes are a fascinating concept in science fiction, cosmology, and theoretical physics. They refer to small, self-contained universes that exist within or alongside our own larger universe. These mini-universes can have their own physical laws, time flows, and spatial dimensions, often separated from our reality by some kind of boundary or dimensional barrier.

### Where the Idea Shows Up

- **Physics**: In some theories like inflationary cosmology, "bubble universes" could form within a larger multiverse, essentially functioning like pocket universes.
- **Science Fiction**: In stories, pocket universes are often created artificially by advanced technology, magic, or cosmic accidents. They’re used as secret hideouts, prisons, or experimental zones.
- **Fantasy and Mythology**: You also see this idea in myths — think of realms like Olympus or Avalon, which are tucked away, separate from the "main" world.

### How They Work (In Fiction)

- **Different Time Flow:** Time might pass faster or slower.
- **Altered Physics:** Gravity, magic, or the laws of energy could work differently.
- **Hidden Entrances:** You need a special key, ritual, or technology to enter.
- **Limited Size:** They’re often smaller than full universes, sometimes just big enough for a single world or structure.

### Real Science Angle

We don’t have any direct evidence for pocket universes, but ideas like **the multiverse**, **brane theory**, and **cosmic inflation** leave room for something like them to exist — at least mathematically. If real, they could explain weird things like **dark matter** or even be linked to concepts like **wormholes**.

Are you thinking about pocket universes for a story, or just diving into the weird side of physics?
