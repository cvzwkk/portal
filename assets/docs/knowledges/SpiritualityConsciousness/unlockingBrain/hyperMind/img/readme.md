Based on the diagram, here's an explanation of the concepts illustrated:

**4-D Field-receptive Mental Workspace with Event Horizon of the Brain:**  
This suggests a framework where the brain's cognitive processes are conceptualized in a 4-dimensional space, integrating time as the fourth dimension.   
The "Event Horizon" metaphorically indicates boundaries or transitions in consciousness or mental states.  
  
**Planck Scale Q. Reduction:**   
This likely refers to quantum reduction at the Planck scale, which might relate to how quantum effects could influence consciousness or neural processes at the smallest scales.    
  
**Gravitational Resonance:**  
This concept might be exploring how gravitational forces or fields could play a role in brain function, possibly through quantum or field theories.   
  
**Fractal Brain:**   
The brain's structure can be seen as fractal, meaning self-similar patterns at various scales, which could relate to how complex cognitive processes emerge from simpler neural interactions.  
  
**Qualia:**   
These are the subjective aspects of conscious experience, like the redness of red or the pain of a headache, suggesting how these might be modeled in this framework.  
  
**Self-Consciousness:**   
Positioned near Qualia, this indicates the brain's capacity for self-awareness, possibly linked to the quantum and dimensional aspects shown.  
  
**Whole Organism 5 Senses:**  
The brain interacts with the outer world through sensory inputs, which are processed in this multi-dimensional space.  
  
**Electrome Genome Proteome:**  
This might refer to the integration of electrical activity, genetic information, and protein structures in brain function, suggesting a holistic approach to understanding brain activity.  
  
**Time Arrow (3+1 Dim.):**    
This indicates the flow of time within the 3 spatial dimensions plus time, suggesting how temporal dynamics are crucial in brain processes.  
  
**Zero Point Energy Q. Waves:**    
These could be quantum fluctuations at zero point energy, possibly influencing brain states or consciousness.  
  
**Dark Energy Resonance:**   
An intriguing concept where dark energy, a force driving the universe's expansion, might have some resonance or effect at the brain level.  
  
**4-D Casimir Compression:**   
This might refer to a quantum effect where virtual particles cause a force between two uncharged plates, potentially metaphorically applied to how brain structures or consciousness might compress or interact in 4D space.  
 
**Brain Attractors:**   
These could be states or patterns that the brain's activity naturally gravitates towards, possibly influenced by the various fields and energies mentioned.  
  
**Cosmic Consciousness:**   
This suggests a broader, perhaps universal level of consciousness, tying into the idea of brain attractors and the influence of cosmic or quantum fields.   
   
**ZPE/EMfields:**  
Zero Point Energy and Electromagnetic fields, indicating how these fundamental physical phenomena might interact with or influence brain function.   
   
This diagram proposes a highly speculative and integrative model, combining elements from quantum physics, neuroscience, and possibly even cosmology to explain consciousness and brain function. It's a complex and abstract representation, aiming to bridge different scientific domains to understand the mind in a multi-dimensional context.    
   
Please note that while this is a fascinating conceptual framework, much of it remains speculative and theoretical, not yet fully supported by empirical evidence in current scientific understanding. If you have any specific questions about any part of this model or wish to delve deeper into any concept, feel free to ask!
