**The Laws of the Mind – The Science of Transmutation** could explore how thoughts, beliefs, and mental patterns shape reality — drawing from psychology, neuroscience, metaphysics, and alchemy. “Transmutation” might refer to the conscious transformation of fear into courage, doubt into clarity, or pain into wisdom — essentially, mental alchemy.

1. **Law of Mentalism** – All is mind; the universe is mental.
2. **Law of Vibration** – Thoughts carry frequencies that attract like experiences.
3. **Law of Correspondence** – “As within, so without.”
4. **Neuroplasticity** – The brain’s ability to rewire itself with focused intention.
5. **Emotional Alchemy** – Turning emotional states into fuel for transformation.
6. **The Observer Effect** – The role of consciousness in shaping outcomes.
7. **Shadow Integration** – Transmuting the unconscious into conscious power.
