# Neuromorphic Computing Overview     
  Neuromorphic computing refers to the design and implementation of hardware systems that emulate the structure and function of biological neural networks.     
   These systems aim to achieve brain-like efficiency, adaptability, and parallelism,    
    offering a fundamentally different approach to traditional von Neumann architectures.    

## Core Concepts   
**Biological Inspiration:**  
  - Neurons and Synapses:  
     Neuromorphic chips mimic the spiking activity of biological neurons and the plasticity of synapses.   
  - Parallelism:   
     Like the brain, these systems operate in parallel, making them highly efficient for certain types of computation.  
  - Event-Driven  
     Processing: Instead of continuous computation, neuromorphic systems process information only when an event (e.g., a spike) occurs.  


**Low Power Consumption:**  
  Traditional CPUs and GPUs consume significant power due to frequent memory and processing operations.  
    Neuromorphic chips optimize energy efficiency by reducing unnecessary computations, inspired by the energy-efficient nature of the human brain.  

**Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs):**  
  SNNs are the foundation of neuromorphic computing.  
    They use "spikes" (discrete time events) to transmit information, which closely resembles how biological neurons communicate.
