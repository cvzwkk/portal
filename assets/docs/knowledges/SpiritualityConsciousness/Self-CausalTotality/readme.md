### **Self-Causal Totality**

**Definition:**
Self-Causal Totality is the principle or being that **exists necessarily by its own nature** and **is the cause of itself**. Unlike everything else, which is contingent and dependent on something else for its existence, a self-causal totality requires nothing external—it is both **origin and sustaining principle**.

**Key Features:**

1. **Necessary Existence:** Its existence is not contingent; it cannot not exist.
2. **Self-Generating:** It is cause and effect in itself; nothing outside it is needed to bring it into being.
3. **Totality:** Encompasses all potentialities within itself; nothing lies outside its scope.
4. **Ultimate Ground of Being:** Often equated with the classical notion of God, the Absolute, or the “prime mover” in metaphysics.

**Illustrative Example:**

* Imagine a circle that has no beginning or end and is completely self-contained. A self-causal totality is like that, but in terms of existence itself—it is fully self-sufficient and fully complete.

**Relation to Other Concepts:**

* **Ontological Unity → Self-Causal Totality:** The unity of all existence is expressed as a self-causing entity.
* **Ground of Order → Self-Causal Totality:** The ordered structures of reality emerge from the intrinsic self-causality of the totality.
* **Transcendent Symmetry → Self-Causal Totality:** The symmetry of all things reflects the completeness and self-consistency of this totality.

**In Shadow-Universe Models:**

* The self-causal totality would be the **core or prime layer** from which shadow or mirrored universes derive. These universes are contingent, but the totality is necessary and independent of them.

**Why It Matters:**

* It provides a metaphysical anchor: all multiplicity, duality, and phenomena are grounded in a **single, self-sufficient source**.
* It resolves the problem of infinite regress in causality—there is an **uncaused cause** at the foundation of reality.
