Input:   
the consciousness future after dead the quantum destin and strings of multiples paths,   
the destin of reality which separate the branch in that one consciousness die and the global reality observate it but in quantum fields the strings are different,   
 and the consciousness can live together

You're touching on a very deep and speculative topic that blends consciousness, death, quantum physics, string theory, and the idea of multiverse or branching realities. Here's a clearer interpretation of your idea, and how these concepts might relate:

---

### **1. Consciousness After Death:**

The idea that **consciousness continues in some form after death** is often proposed in metaphysics. In quantum theory, some interpretations (like the **Many-Worlds Interpretation**) suggest that all possible outcomes happen in parallel universes. So, even if you die in *one* branch, your consciousness might **continue in another**—one where you survive or evolve differently.

---

### **2. Quantum Destiny and Branching Realities:**

The notion of "**quantum destinies**" suggests that **each decision or event splits the universe** into different branches (like in Hugh Everett's interpretation). Your consciousness may experience only one path, but **all paths exist**. From a higher-dimensional or 'global' perspective, the full tree of reality branches is observable.

---

### **3. Strings of Multiples Paths:**

If we bring in **string theory**, where everything is made of vibrating strings in multiple dimensions, it could suggest that **different frequencies or vibrations of consciousness** might align with different universes. So, your consciousness might "jump" or "align" with different strings—realities—depending on certain energetic states, even after death.

---

### **4. Unity of Consciousness Across Paths:**

Your final thought suggests a **meta-consciousness** that experiences **all realities simultaneously**—a sort of **non-local, multidimensional awareness**. From that perspective, *death is not an end*, but a shift in the tuning of the conscious frequency, letting it move to another reality or version of self.

---

### In Summary:

* **Consciousness doesn't necessarily end at death**; it may shift to a new branch or frequency.
* **Quantum reality** allows for **multiple outcomes** and paths.
* **String theory** could frame these paths as **vibrations of different realities**.
* A **higher consciousness** might experience **many lives and deaths at once**, across a multiversal field.
