# The Platelet-Derived Growth Factor subunit A (PDGF-AA)   
represented by the UniProtKB accession number P04085, has a well-characterized amino acid sequence.   

The sequence and its biological functions are well-documented in scientific research.   
Below is the detailed information:   
Amino Acid Sequence of PDGF-AA (UniProtKB: P04085)   
The full-length PDGF-AA protein is composed of 109 amino acids.   
Here's the sequence:  

```MKTWSIVLLLSALALAWPRRAGSPNFSHRSRAGGFPFQQDLPDLSGAEAFQGWASQGTGLRKKQKSKGAYLNSMGKNRAGYFQPSPEVQNSAKYYVQRQKAGQLEWRSHVQQLK```

**Explanation of the sequence:**   
**Signal peptide:** The first 24 amino acids (MKTWSIVLLLSALALAW) form a signal peptide that helps the protein to be directed into the secretory pathway.
**Mature PDGF-AA:** The rest of the sequence represents the mature form of PDGF-AA, which is involved in signaling processes related to cell growth, division, and repair.

**Function & Mechanism:**
PDGF-AA typically functions as a ligand for the PDGF receptor (PDGFR), which is involved in cell proliferation, migration, and survival. PDGF-AA is often secreted by platelets and plays a critical role in angiogenesis, wound healing, and tissue regeneration.
It specifically binds to the PDGFR-α receptor, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase. Binding of PDGF-AA to PDGFR-α initiates a signal transduction cascade that affects cellular behaviors like proliferation and survival.

**Lab-Made and Self-Development Sources:**
PDGF-AA, like other recombinant proteins, can be produced using recombinant DNA technology. The gene encoding PDGF-AA can be cloned into expression vectors, and the protein can be expressed in host cells like E. coli, yeast, or mammalian cells for research and therapeutic use.
In laboratories, researchers may use synthetic biology tools to modify or synthesize PDGF-AA for specific experimental conditions, such as in wound healing models, cancer research, and tissue engineering studies.

**Scientific Sources & Validation:**
**UniProt (P04085):** The sequence and details of PDGF-AA are documented in the UniProtKB database, which provides verified and curated protein data.
**PubMed:** Numerous studies have characterized the amino acid sequence, functional roles, and signaling pathways of PDGF-AA, validating its critical function in tissue repair and development. Relevant references can be found by searching for "PDGF-AA" and "P04085" on PubMed.
**Gene Therapy and Recombinant Proteins:** Laboratories that work on gene therapy, wound healing, and regenerative medicine often develop recombinant PDGF-AA proteins for use in clinical and experimental applications. For instance, PDGF-based products like becaplermin (Regranex) have been developed for wound healing therapies.
