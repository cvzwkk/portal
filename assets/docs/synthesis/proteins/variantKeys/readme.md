### **7. OXTR (Oxytocin Receptor) Gene**
- **Overview**: The OXTR gene is involved in the production and reception of oxytocin, a hormone and neurotransmitter associated with bonding, empathy, and social interactions.
- **Types**:
  - **A/A Genotype**: Associated with higher sensitivity to oxytocin and better social bonding.
  - **G/G Genotype**: Associated with lower oxytocin receptor sensitivity and may result in less empathetic behavior.
